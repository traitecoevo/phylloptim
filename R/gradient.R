# Trait gradients (issue #4, PLAN 11d stage 1).
#
# dA/dtheta, dgs/dtheta and dpsi_leaf/dtheta at a solved operating point, for the
# traits. The customer is `leaf-calibration`, whose hierarchical fit spent 97.6%
# of 10,045 model evaluations on finite-difference gradients.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, in one paragraph, because the arithmetic that motivated
# it did not survive being measured. The plan was that the implicit function
# theorem would replace 2N re-solves per gradient with 2N evaluations of the exact
# `dprofit`, at 7% of the cost of a solve, for a 10x win in the R layer. The
# theorem is right and it is implemented below. The 10x is not there, and the
# reason is worth stating once: in R the per-call overhead (~1.8 us) is seven
# times the C++ work it wraps (0.26 us), so replacing a 3.6 us solve with a
# 0.26 us gradient evaluation saves almost nothing measurable from R. What DOES
# dominate is that perturbing a trait used to mean constructing a new Leaf, which
# costs ~204 us -- 55 solves. `set_traits()` removed that, and it is where the
# speedup actually came from. See PLAN 11d for the numbers and for what stage 2
# has to do instead.
#
# ⚠️ THAT PARAGRAPH IS TRUE AND IT WAS OVER-GENERALISED, INCLUDING HERE. "The
# value of this file is exactness, not speed" held for the case measured -- a fit
# whose parameters ARE traits, one per fitted parameter. It is false for a fit
# where they are not. Both arms are linear in a parameter count, and it is a
# DIFFERENT count for each:
#
#   T_fd    = 2 * P_fit   * T_objective
#   T_exact = N * (t_construct + t_solve)  +  2 * P_model * N * t_eval
#
# `optim` differences the P_fit parameters it is moving; `leaf_gradient()` is asked
# for the P_model parameters the leaf actually has. Those are equal only when the
# fit varies traits directly. Any parameterisation in between -- pooling, a
# hierarchy, a shared or derived parameter -- makes P_fit > P_model, and the
# composite's cost does not follow the optimiser's dimension.
#
# Measured both regimes: vignette("fitting")'s 72-observation trait fit has
# P_fit == P_model and the composite loses at every count up to 13. The companion
# study `leaf-calibration` has N = 1327, P_fit = 40, P_model = 4 and it wins 3.4x,
# converging to the same optimum -- and its 57-parameter variant costs the SAME as
# its 40-parameter one, because P_model is 4 in both. One set of per-observation
# coefficients fitted on the first design predicts the second to ~5%.
#
# So: the value of the code below is EXACTNESS, the ACTIVE-SET CLASSIFICATION, and
# speed WHEN P_fit EXCEEDS P_model. The classification is still the part that took
# the work. Do not quote a speed verdict from this file without saying which of the
# two counts it was denominated in -- that conflation has now cost this family a
# retraction in each direction.

##' Replace the traits on an existing leaf
##'
##' Changes the traits of a `Leaf` in place, leaving [leaf_control()]'s numerical
##' settings alone. This is the fast path for anything that varies traits --
##' calibration, sensitivity analysis, a trait response curve -- because
##' constructing a `Leaf` from R costs about fifty times as much as solving one.
##'
##' @section You must set the drivers again afterwards:
##' This returns the leaf to its just-constructed state, so [set_drivers()] has to
##' be called before the next solve. That is not caution: `vcmax_`, `jmax_` and
##' `R_d_` are derived from the traits inside `set_physiology()`, so they are
##' genuinely unknown until the drivers are re-supplied.
##'
##' The reason it is a function rather than fourteen assignable fields is that
##' `leaf$vcmax_25 <- x` could not be made correct. Three separate pieces of
##' derived state go stale on a bare trait write: the two pre-integrated
##' vulnerability splines, the solved operating point, and -- least visibly --
##' `vcmax_`/`jmax_`/`R_d_`, which `set_physiology()` computes behind a cache keyed
##' on leaf temperature and O2 alone. That last one means the obvious repair,
##' "change the trait and then set the drivers again", silently does not work.

##' Trait gradients of a solved operating point
##'
##' The derivatives of the solved outputs with respect to the traits:
##' `dA/dtheta`, `dgc/dtheta`, `dpsi_stem/dtheta`, `dcollar/dtheta` and
##' `dprofit/dtheta`, at one operating point.
##'
##' @section It differentiates ONE cost curve, whichever you last solved with:
##' The operating point here is always the one `find_root_collar_psi()` produces --
##' the TF24 cost, maximised over the root-collar potential. That is not a
##' configurable choice: the solve is called internally, so the cost curve is
##' fixed no matter which optimiser you called on the leaf beforehand.
##'
##' ⚠️ **So a gradient requested for a leaf you set up for another cost curve is
##' the TF24 gradient, silently.** `$optimise_psi_stem_CF77()` and
##' `$optimise_psi_stem_ProfitMax()` maximise different objectives over `psi_stem`
##' rather than the collar, and neither is what this function differentiates.
##' There is no warning, because the numbers that come back are perfectly good
##' TF24 derivatives.
##'
##' Differentiating the others needs `dprofit` for each curve, which does not
##' exist yet. Until it does, treat this as TF24-only.
##'
##' @section The maths, and why it is not just a finite difference:
##' The reported outputs are evaluated at the profit-maximising collar potential
##' `psi*`, so a trait moves them two ways: directly, and by moving `psi*`. At an
##' interior optimum `dprofit/dpsi = 0`, and differentiating that condition gives
##' `psi*`'s response without re-solving the model:
##'
##' \deqn{d\psi^*/d\theta = -M / H, \quad
##'       M = \partial^2 profit/\partial\psi\partial\theta, \quad
##'       H = \partial^2 profit/\partial\psi^2}
##'
##' \deqn{dY/d\theta = \partial Y/\partial\theta|_\psi +
##'                    (\partial Y/\partial\psi)(d\psi^*/d\theta)}
##'
##' Both second derivatives are differences of `dprofit_droot_collar_psi()`, which
##' is exact in `psi` and smooth in the traits -- `psi` is one of its arguments, so
##' no argmax is involved and `M` is a first difference of an exact quantity. It is
##' stable to seven significant figures across five decades of step size.
##'
##' The second term is not a correction. For `TF24_cost_scale`, `TF24_beta2`, `stem_b`
##' and `stem_c` it is 100% of the answer, and for `vcmax_25` 52%.
##'
##' @section profit, which is the one output the envelope theorem reaches:
##' The first four outputs are what a gas-exchange calibration observes. `profit`
##' is here because it is what a **demographic** consumer bills: plant's carbon
##' budget reads `leaf.profit_`, not `assim_colimited_`, so before it was added
##' the two sets were disjoint and no gradient from this package reached a
##' demographic model at all.
##'
##' It is also the cheapest of the five, because it is the objective. At an
##' interior optimum `dprofit/dpsi = 0`, so the indirect term above vanishes
##' identically and
##'
##' \deqn{dprofit/d\theta = \partial profit/\partial\theta|_{\psi^*}}
##'
##' -- the direct partial alone, with no `dY/dpsi` and no `-M/H`. That is the
##' envelope theorem, and it is the only place this package uses it.
##'
##' ⚠️ **The term this drops is noise, not an `h^2` truncation, and that is why
##' dropping it matters.** `profit` is the maximum, so it is flat, and a central
##' difference of it at `psi*` divides the solve's ~1e-09 floor by a ~1e-06 step.
##' Over the golden grid's 136 interior rows:
##'
##' | | median | max |
##' |---|---|---|
##' | `\|dprofit/dpsi\|`, exact (forward AD) | 4.8e-15 | 5.4e-10 |
##' | `\|dprofit/dpsi\|`, central difference | 7.8e-10 | 2.1e-04 |
##' | relative move in `dprofit/dtheta` if kept | 2.7e-10 | 8.0e-05 |
##'
##' Eleven orders between the two instruments at the median, and the worst row
##' sits in the band this package calls a real difference. So `dprofit/dtheta` is
##' set from the direct term rather than computed through the composite, exactly
##' as `collar` is set from `dpsi*/dtheta` rather than differenced.
##'
##' ⚠️ **The envelope does not survive the active set.** At a pinned optimum
##' `psi*` is a trait-dependent bound and `dprofit/dpsi` is not zero there, so the
##' indirect term is real. This applies the identity only where `status` is
##' `"interior"`; everywhere else `profit` goes through the same finite-difference
##' fallback as the other four.
##'
##' @section A collar potential you supply, instead of the one this solves for:
##' Pass `psi` and the outputs are evaluated at that collar rather than at the
##' argmax. This is for a caller whose model **tracks** the optimum instead of
##' finding it — plant's TF24f carries the collar potential as an ODE state,
##' `dpsi/dt = k * dprofit/dpsi`, so at finite gain its `dprofit/dpsi` is
##' deliberately non-zero and *is* the acclimation rate.
##'
##' There the derivation above simplifies rather than breaks. `psi` is exogenous,
##' so the indirect term is whatever the caller says it is:
##'
##' \deqn{dY/d\theta = \partial Y/\partial\theta|_\psi +
##'                    (\partial Y/\partial\psi)(d\psi/d\theta)}
##'
##' with `dpsi_dtheta` supplied — defaulting to zero, the partial at fixed
##' collar. Nothing is derived from `-M/H`, so nothing needs stationarity, and
##' `method` is refused because the two routes it chooses between are both about
##' a solved optimum.
##'
##' `M`, `H` and `dY_dpsi` come back in the result, because a caller with a
##' *dynamic* `psi` cannot supply `dpsi_dtheta` as a constant: for the
##' gradient-ascent law above it obeys `ds/dt = k(M + H s)`, and those are its
##' coefficients. Its fixed point is `-M/H`, which is what the solving path
##' returns — the two agree in the large-gain limit.
##'
##' ⚠️ **`stationarity` is still reported, and is used for exactly one thing.**
##' It no longer routes anything; it now measures how far the collar you supplied
##' sits from the optimum. The one decision it makes is `profit`'s: at a
##' stationary point the envelope theorem applies and the analytic zero is used,
##' and away from one the exact `dprofit/dpsi` is used instead of differencing
##' it. So `psi = <the solved psi*>` with `dpsi_dtheta = -M/H` reproduces the
##' solving path **bit-for-bit**, which the tests assert.
##'
##' ⚠️ **An infeasible `psi` gets no gradient either**, reported as
##' `"no-gradient"`. `dprofit/dpsi` is a sentinel `0.0` on the shut-down and
##' reversed-gradient exits rather than a derivative, and this path never divides
##' by `H`, so it would otherwise adopt that zero as the real thing.
##'
##' ⚠️ **A clamped `psi` gets no gradient, and that is the interesting case.**
##' The collar actually used is `psi` clamped into the feasible interval, so it
##' moves with the *bound* rather than with `dpsi_dtheta` — the active-set
##' problem, arriving through the clamp instead of through the optimiser. The
##' direct term alone would be plausible and wrong. `status` reports `"clamped"`
##' and the gradient is all `NA`; `psi` in the result is the collar that was
##' used. This is reported rather than thrown because a tracking model reaches
##' these points routinely — the clamp is how TF24f pulls an out-of-range state
##' back inside — and it fires for a `psi` within one step of an end too, since
##' `dY/dpsi` cannot be centred there.
##'
##' @section The active set, which is the reason this function is careful:
##' Stationarity is the premise of the whole derivation, and it fails when the
##' optimum is pinned to an end of the feasible collar interval. There `psi*` is a
##' bound, `dprofit` is not zero at the answer, and `-M/H` is not the bound's
##' derivative. The formula does not fail loudly: measured at a wet-pinned point
##' the true gradient is about `1e-08` and the bare composite returns `O(1)` --
##' plausible-looking and wrong by seven orders of magnitude. About one operating
##' point in six is pinned across this package's test grid, all at soil suctions of
##' 3-4 MPa, which is the dry end a drought calibration will visit.
##'
##' So the premise is **tested rather than assumed**. The test is the implied
##' Newton step `|dprofit(psi*) / H|`, a distance in MPa: at a stationary point it
##' is zero to solver precision, and at a pinned one it is not. Over the package's
##' 288-point grid the two populations are five orders of magnitude apart -- worst
##' interior `5e-11`, smallest pinned `6e-06` -- so `stationarity_tol` sits in an
##' empty band rather than on a judgement call.
##'
##' When the premise does not hold, this falls back to a central finite difference
##' of the whole solve, which respects the constraint by construction because it
##' differences the constrained answer. That is the one thing the crude method does
##' better, and `method` in the result says which was used.
##'
##' It is better in a second way, which is sharper than accuracy. `psi_crit` does
##' not appear in the profit function at all -- it only sets the dry end of the
##' feasible collar interval -- so the composite necessarily returns **exactly
##' zero** for it. At an interior optimum that is correct. At a dry-pinned optimum
##' `psi_crit` *is* the binding constraint, the true `dA/dθ` is about `1.26`, and a
##' zero is arguably a worse answer than a wildly wrong one: it tells an optimiser
##' the parameter does nothing, and nothing about it looks suspicious. The
##' difference of the solve gets it for free.
##'
##' There is a second guard behind that one, found by measurement rather than
##' designed: a pinned optimum sits so close to its bound that the difference in
##' `psi` cannot be centred there without being clamped, and that is detected too.
##' Over this package's grid it catches every pinned point on its own, so forcing
##' `method = "ift"` at one fails loudly instead of returning the wrong number.
##' Do not read that as making the stationarity test redundant -- it fires only
##' when the feasible interval is narrow, which is true of these points but not of
##' pinned optima in general.
##'
##' @section Two of these are not traits:
##' `pars` also accepts `leaf_specific_conductance_max` and, on the
##' single-potential path, `resistance`. They are here because a calibration fits
##' them: of `leaf-calibration`'s four free parameters two are traits and two are
##' these, so restricting `pars` to [leaf_traits()] left half of that fit without
##' an exact gradient.
##'
##' Nothing in the derivation cares that the parameter is a trait — the implicit
##' function theorem is applied to `dprofit/dpsi = 0`, and any parameter the profit
##' function depends on goes through it identically. What differs is only which
##' setter applies the perturbation. `leaf_specific_conductance_max` is also how
##' plant's height reaches the leaf, so the same route gives a gradient with
##' respect to plant state and not only with respect to traits.
##'
##' ⚠️ **Both move the feasible collar interval, not just the profit function** —
##' `resistance` directly and `leaf_specific_conductance_max` through the supply
##' curve — so a perturbation can push a bound past `psi*` more readily than a
##' trait perturbation can. That is the case the clamp detector below exists for,
##' and it fails loudly rather than quietly.
##'
##' @section What it costs, and when that beats differencing:
##' Both routes are linear in a parameter count, and it is a **different** count
##' for each. With `N` observations:
##'
##' \deqn{T_{FD} = 2\,P_{fit}\,T_{objective}}
##' \deqn{T_{exact} = N\,(t_{construct} + t_{solve}) + 2\,P_{model}\,N\,t_{eval}}
##'
##' An optimiser differences the `P_fit` parameters it is moving. This function is
##' asked for the `P_model` parameters the leaf has — the length of `pars`. Those
##' are equal only when the fit varies traits directly; a parameterisation in
##' between (pooling, a hierarchy, any shared or derived parameter) makes
##' `P_fit > P_model`, and then this route's cost does not follow the optimiser's
##' dimension.
##'
##' ⚠️ **So "is the exact gradient faster" has no answer independent of your
##' parameterisation, and both regimes are measured.** `vignette("fitting")` fits
##' 72 observations with `P_fit == P_model` and this loses at every count up to 13.
##' The companion study `leaf-calibration` has `N = 1327`, `P_fit = 40`,
##' `P_model = 4`, wins 3.4x, and reaches the same optimum — with its
##' 57-parameter variant costing the same as its 40-parameter one, because
##' `P_model` is 4 in both.
##'
##' ⚠️ **Always pass `pars`.** It is `P_model`, so the default — all fifteen on
##' the multi-layer path — is the most expensive thing you can ask for, and a fit
##' that reads four of them pays for eleven it discards.
##'
##' The intercept is a fresh `Leaf` per call, which there is currently no way to
##' avoid (see phylloptim#52); it is 29% of the exact gradient in the study above.
##'
##' @section Precision:
##' Do not ask for more than about `1e-09` from any of this. That is the
##' achievable precision of the solved outputs themselves, set by the tolerance of
##' the intercellular-CO2 root-find.
##'
##' @section Reusing a leaf across gradients:
##' Constructing a `Leaf` costs ~155 µs and this function does it once per call, which
##' is **about 40% of a one-parameter gradient** — the largest single term on this
##' surface, and paid once per observation by a fit that differentiates per
##' observation. Pass `x` to reuse one:
##'
##' ```r
##' l <- leaf_model(traits, control, supply)
##' for (i in seq_len(n)) leaf_gradient(psi_soil = ps[i], x = l, traits = traits, pars = FIT)
##' ```
##'
##' `x` is a **vessel, not the point**: `traits` still says where the gradient is
##' taken and is applied to `x`, rather than read from it (a `Leaf` does not expose
##' its traits). That is why `traits` is required with `x` — defaulting it would
##' differentiate at the package defaults on somebody else's leaf and return a
##' plausible answer for a point nobody asked about.
##'
##' `control` and `supply` are fixed when `x` is built, so passing them alongside it
##' is an error rather than silently resolved.
##'
##' **`x` is left solved at the base point**, not at the last perturbation — the
##' state this function seats it in, restored on the way out including on an error.
##' The restore costs one re-trait and one solve, ~20 µs against the ~155 saved.
##'
##' @inheritParams set_drivers
##' @param x an existing `Leaf` from [leaf_model()] to reuse instead of building
##'   one, for a loop that takes many gradients. `traits` is required with it, and
##'   `control`/`supply` must be omitted. See the section above.
##' @param traits a [leaf_traits()] object: the point in trait space to
##'   differentiate at
##' @param control a [leaf_control()] object
##' @param supply how water reaches the root collar: [leaf_supply_multilayer()]
##'   (the default) or [leaf_supply_single()]
##' @param pars what to differentiate with respect to. Any of the fourteen
##'   [leaf_traits()] names, plus `"leaf_specific_conductance_max"` and — on the
##'   single-potential path only — `"resistance"`. Defaults to all of them.
##'
##'   `dY/dvcmax_25` is a PARTIAL at fixed respiration: `R_d_25` is its own trait,
##'   so a fit that wants respiration to follow Vcmax moves both and adds the two
##'   columns.
##'
##'   `beta_R_H` and `beta_R_V` were here until #33 and are not any more: they
##'   parameterise the root-architecture model, which the leaf no longer runs, so
##'   this function has no way to reach them. Getting a gradient in either means
##'   solving at two networks yourself. The perturbation itself is cheap —
##'   [root_network_from_carbon()] is homogeneous of degree 1 in each constant, so
##'   scaling `beta_R_H` scales `r_R_H_min` by the same factor and needs no
##'   rebuild — but the two solves are still two solves.
##' @param psi a collar water potential to evaluate at, in MPa as a positive
##'   magnitude, instead of solving for the profit-maximising one. `NULL` (the
##'   default) solves. See the section above; `method` cannot be given with it.
##' @param dpsi_dtheta how the prescribed `psi` itself responds to each
##'   parameter, as one value per entry of `pars` (or one value recycled, or a
##'   vector named by `pars`). Defaults to zero, which is the partial derivative
##'   at fixed collar. Must be finite — an infinite value would return an
##'   all-infinite gradient row with a finite, plausible-looking `profit` in it,
##'   because the envelope theorem assigns that column rather than multiplying
##'   through. Only meaningful with `psi`.
##' @param step relative step for the trait difference. The default `1e-06` is
##'   near the middle of the five decades over which the mixed partial was
##'   measured stable; it is also used, relative to the collar potential, for the
##'   two differences in `psi`.
##' @param stationarity_tol how far from stationary, as an implied Newton step in
##'   MPa, the solved point may be before the optimum is called pinned and the
##'   finite-difference fallback is used. The default `1e-08` sits in the empty
##'   band between the two measured populations; there is no operating point in
##'   this package's grid within four orders of magnitude of it.
##' @param fast_stem_curve perturb `stem_b` without rebuilding the stem
##'   vulnerability spline (`TRUE`, the default). The curve is homogeneous of
##'   degree 1 in `stem_b`, so the spline for a perturbed `stem_b` is the existing
##'   one with its argument rescaled — which makes the rebuild, otherwise most of
##'   the cost of that gradient, unnecessary. `FALSE` rebuilds, and exists so the
##'   equivalence is checkable rather than assumed; the package's tests require
##'   the two routes to agree. `stem_c` has no such identity and always rebuilds.
##' @param method which route to take: `"auto"` (the default) uses the
##'   implicit-function composite where its premise holds and the finite
##'   difference where it does not. `"ift"` and `"fd"` force one route, for
##'   checking one against the other. Forcing `"ift"` at a pinned optimum returns
##'   a confidently wrong number -- that is the whole reason `"auto"` exists --
##'   and `status` still reports the truth about the point.
