# Converting published vulnerability curves to (P50, c).
#
# The model is parameterised on (P50, c) since the curve became
# `f(psi) = 2^-(psi/P50)^c`. Published curves arrive as almost anything else: a
# P88, a P95, a P50 plus a slope. All of it inverts in closed form, so the
# conversion belongs here rather than in each study that needs it -- which is what
# four hand-written copies of `psi_at_plc` downstream had become.
#
# ⚠️ EVERY POTENTIAL HERE IS A POSITIVE MAGNITUDE. Published P50 is negative
# (-3.95 MPa); this package uses magnitudes throughout, so `P50` means `|P50|`.
# A negative input is refused rather than silently negated, because a caller who
# passes a signed value is working in the other convention and everything else they
# pass is likely signed too.

# log2(1/f) for a remaining-conductivity fraction f. This is the only place the
# quantile arithmetic lives.

# S50 = 50*c*ln2/|P50|. The 50 is because the slope is conventionally quoted in

##' The water potential at a given loss of conductivity
##'
##' Inverts `f(psi) = 2^-(psi/P50)^c` for the potential at which a given fraction
##' of conductivity has been lost.
##'
##' @param P50 potential at 50% loss, MPa as a positive magnitude
##' @param c shape parameter of the Weibull curve (unitless)
##' @param plc proportion of conductivity LOST, in `(0, 1)`. `plc = 0.5` returns
##'   `P50` by construction; `0.88`, `0.95` and `0.99` return P88, P95 and P99.
##'
##' @return The potential, MPa as a positive magnitude.
##' @seealso [weibull_p50_c()] for the reverse, and [leaf_traits()] for where the

##' The slope of the vulnerability curve at P50
##'
##' `S50 = 50*c*ln(2)/|P50|`, in % PLC per MPa, which is the other form
##' vulnerability curves are commonly published in.
##'
##' ⚠️ **`S50` is not an independent shape parameter** — it has `P50` built into it
##' by construction, so a curve is not determined by `S50` alone. It is exported
##' rather than kept internal for exactly that reason: a caller reading a published
##' `S50` needs to see what it depends on.
##'
##' @inheritParams psi_at_plc
##' @return The slope at P50, % PLC per MPa.
##' @seealso [weibull_p50_c()], which accepts `S50` as one of its two inputs.
##' @examples
##' weibull_s50(3.4, 2.680147)
##' @export
weibull_s50 <- function(P50, c) {
  .weibull_check_p50_c(P50, c)
  .WEIBULL_S50_K * c / P50

##' Convert a Weibull scale parameter to P50
##'
##' `b` is the scale of the conventional form `exp(-(psi/b)^c)`; this package is
##' parameterised on `P50` instead. The two are one substitution apart,
##' `b = P50 / (ln 2)^(1/c)`, so
##'
##' \deqn{P_{50} = b\,(\ln 2)^{1/c}}
##'
##' Exported because published fits and older datasets carry `b`, and the
##' alternative is that conversion being pasted at each call site. `Leaf` reports
##' `stem_b` and `root_b` as derived read-only accessors, which is the forward
##' direction of the same identity.
##'
##' ⚠️ **`P50` is always SMALLER than `b`**, by a factor of `(ln 2)^(1/c)` — 0.87
##' at `c = 2.68`. So passing a `b` where a `P50` is wanted, or the reverse, gives
##' a plausible number roughly 15% out rather than an error. Neither function can
##' detect it: both arguments are positive potentials in MPa.
##'
##' @param b scale parameter of the Weibull curve, MPa as a positive magnitude
##' @inheritParams psi_at_plc
##' @return `P50`, MPa as a positive magnitude.
##' @seealso [weibull_p50_c()], [psi_at_plc()]
##' @examples

##' Recover (P50, c) from any two published quantities
##'
##' A vulnerability curve has two parameters, so **any two** of the quantities
##' below determine it. This solves for `(P50, c)` from whichever pair you have.
##'
##' @section Which pairs are closed-form:
##' All of them except `S50` paired with a quantile other than P50, which is
##' transcendental in `c` and is solved by a root-find over `c` in `(0, 20]`.
##' Everything else follows from
##'
##' \deqn{P_f = P_{50}\,\big(\log_2(1/f)\big)^{1/c}}
##'
##' with `f` the remaining fraction (`f = 1 - PLC`), so `log2(1/f)` is 1, 3.0589,
##' 4.3219 and 6.6439 for P50, P88, P95 and P99. From two quantiles,
##' `c = ln(L2/L1) / ln(P_f2/P_f1)`.
##'
##' @section Guards:
##' `c > 0` is required. A `c` below 1 is **warned about rather than refused**: it
##' is possible, but across measured angiosperm stems it usually flags a
##' measurement artefact — native embolism already present at low tension flattens
##' the curve — rather than a real trait. For reference, `c = 2.0` is a reasonable
##' default for angiosperm stems, measured 1.8–2.6 across three species whose P50
##' spanned 2.9–4.3 MPa, i.e. shape roughly conserved while scale varied freely.
##'
##' @param P50,P88,P95,P99 potentials at 50%, 88%, 95% and 99% loss of
##'   conductivity, MPa as positive magnitudes
##' @param px,plc an arbitrary quantile: the potential `px` at which the
##'   proportion `plc` of conductivity is lost. Supply both or neither; the pair
##'   counts as ONE of the two quantities.
##' @param S50 slope at P50, % PLC per MPa. See [weibull_s50()].
##' @param c shape parameter, if you already have it.
##'
##' @return A list with `P50` and `c`, suitable for splicing into

# ⚠️ AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A UNIQUE SOLUTION. Written out,

#     S50(c) = K * c * L^(1/c) / psi_f
