# Trait gradients over many observations at once (issue #4, PLAN 11d stage 2).
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. `leaf_gradient()` in `gradient.R` computes one
# observation's gradient in R, over primitives that are already C++. Measured
# after #69 and #70, a four-parameter gradient costs ~237 us per observation and
# the model work inside it is 6 us -- 1.5%. The other 98.5% is 112 crossings of
# the R boundary and the interpreter around them. `tests/cpp/bench_gradient.cpp`
# times the same composite in C++ at 1.8 us per trait.
#
# So the fix is not a faster gradient, it is ONE CROSSING. The composite is
# transcribed into `inst/include/phylloptim/gradient.hpp` and looped over
# observations there; this file is the surface that gets it a parameter matrix in
# and three arrays out. For a 1,327-observation MCMC at 30,000 draws that is
# ~2.6 h against ~7 min.
#
# ⚠️ WHAT STAYS IN R, AND WHY THAT IS NOT LAZINESS. The likelihood and the
# parameterisation Jacobian. The likelihood is the CALLER's model -- sigma,
# robustness, a hierarchy -- and putting one in C++ would commit this package to
# it. The Jacobian belongs in R because that is where the win comes from:
# `leaf-calibration` maps 40 fitted parameters onto 4 model ones, so C++ returns
# dY/dtheta for the four and R applies a 40 x 4 chain rule, vectorised over
# observations. That is exactly the `P_fit > P_model` structure
# `vignette("fitting")` identified as where an exact gradient wins at all -- see
# `gradient.R`'s header for the two cost laws and the retraction in each
# direction that produced them.
#
# ⚠️ AND THE THING TO BE MOST CAREFUL ABOUT: the C++ composite is a SECOND
# implementation of `leaf_gradient()`, so R remains the reference and the two are
# required to agree BIT-FOR-BIT. `gradient.hpp`'s header records the three rules
# that makes possible (literal arithmetic order, no fused multiply-add, explicit
# call sequencing) and `test-gradient-batch.R` is what holds them.

##' The observations a batch gradient is taken over
##'
##' Resolves N observations' drivers once and holds them C++-side, together with
##' one `Leaf`. Hand the result to [leaf_gradient_batch()], repeatedly: the
##' drivers do not change across a fit, only the parameters do.
##'
##' @section Why this is a separate call:
##' Because the conversion is expensive and the gradient is not. A [RootNetwork()]
##' costs 60-100 µs to cross the R boundary — some 60 times a trivial `.Call`,
##' because it is an `RcppR6` `list:` class and every crossing rebuilds a
##' five-element named list. Converting 1,327 of them per likelihood evaluation
##' would cost ~80 ms and swamp the ~13 ms of gradient it was carrying. The same
##' argument applies to the `Leaf`: constructing one from R costs ~204 µs, about
##' 70 solves, so a fit builds it once here rather than once per gradient (#52).
##'
##' ⚠️ **The result holds a C++ pointer, so it does not survive `saveRDS()` or a
##' new session.** Rebuild it rather than restoring it; [leaf_gradient_batch()]
##' says so rather than crashing if you try.
##'
##' @section Recycling:
##' The same rules as [leaf_solve()]. `PPFD`, `atm_vpd`, `ca`, `leaf_temp`,
##' `atm_o2_kpa`, `atm_kpa` and `leaf_specific_conductance_max` are recycled to a
##' common length. `psi_soil` is recycled when it is a plain numeric vector, each
##' element then being a single-layer observation; pass a list of numeric vectors
##' for multi-layer ones, and `soil_depth` follows the same rule. `root_network`
##' is either one [RootNetwork()] used for every observation, or a list of them.

##' Trait gradients over a batch of observations
##'
##' [leaf_gradient()], composed in C++ and vectorised over the observations of a
##' [leaf_batch()]. One crossing of the R boundary per call, in place of 112 per
##' observation.
##'
##' @param psi one collar water potential per observation to evaluate at
##'   (positive magnitudes, MPa) instead of solving for the profit-maximising
##'   one. See [leaf_gradient()]'s section on it. Recycling a single value across
##'   the batch is deliberately not offered — rows sharing an imposed collar is a
##'   coincidence rather than a design, and broadcasting one would make a length
##'   mismatch look intentional.
##' @param dpsi_dtheta how each prescribed `psi` responds to each parameter:
##'   an `n` × `length(pars)` matrix, or one vector of `length(pars)` shared by
##'   every observation. Defaults to zero. Must be finite, for the reason
##'   [leaf_gradient()] records. Only meaningful with `psi`.
##'
##' @section What it computes, and where the maths is written down:
##' The same five derivatives at the same solved operating point, by the same two
##' routes, with the same active-set test deciding between them. **Read
##' [leaf_gradient()]'s documentation for all of it** — the implicit function
##' theorem, why the second term is not a correction, why the premise is tested
##' rather than assumed, and what `status` means. Nothing here differs; this is a
##' transcription, and it is required to agree with the R version bit-for-bit.
##'
##' @section Speed, and which side of the boundary the figure belongs to:
##' A four-parameter gradient costs ~237 µs per observation through
##' [leaf_gradient()], of which the model work — two solves — is 6 µs, or 1.5%.
##' Everything else is dispatch and the R interpreter. The C++ composite runs at
##' ~1.8 µs per trait, so the same gradient is order 10 µs here.
##'
##' ⚠️ **That is a per-observation figure and it needs a batch to be realised.**
##' Calling this with one observation pays the whole R-side call overhead for one
##' row's worth of work and will not be 20× anything. The number of observations
##' is the lever.
##'
##' @section Per-row status, not an error:
##' A proposal during a fit **will** reach operating points the solve cannot
##' handle. That has to cost those rows rather than the whole dataset, so every
##' row reports its own `status` and a failure is `"error"` with a `message`
##' rather than a condition. A failed row's gradient is all `NA`, not partially
##' filled: a parameter loop that failed halfway has valid entries before the
##' failure, and returning them next to `status == "error"` would invite a caller
##' who checks the status per row to read a gradient with a hole in it. `value`,
##' `H` and `stationarity` are kept where they were determined, because they
##' describe the point rather than the derivative.
##'
##' @section Supplying `theta` directly:
##' By default the parameters are `traits` — the batch's, or the ones passed here
##' — with `leaf_specific_conductance_max` and `resistance` taken from the
##' batch's own drivers. Pass `theta` instead when they vary by observation, which
##' is what a hierarchical fit needs: a matrix with one row per observation (or one
##' row shared by all of them) and one column per [gradient_par_names()] entry, in
##' that order. `resistance` is ignored on the multi-layer path and may be `NA`
##' there.
##'
##' @param batch a [leaf_batch()]
##' @param traits a [leaf_traits()] object: the point in trait space to
##'   differentiate at. Defaults to the one `batch` was built with. Ignored when
##'   `theta` is given.
##' @param pars what to differentiate with respect to, as in [leaf_gradient()].
##'   ⚠️ **Always pass it.** It is `P_model`, so the default — all of them — is
##'   the most expensive thing you can ask for.
##' @param theta the model parameters as a matrix, for the case where they vary
##'   by observation. See the section above.
