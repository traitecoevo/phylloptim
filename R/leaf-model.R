# The friendly R surface (issue #5, stage 2).
#
# Everything here is hand-written and sits ABOVE the generated glue in
# R/RcppR6.R, which is what makes it rewritable without touching the build, the
# YAML or CI. Nothing in this file reaches into C++ except through the generated
# `Leaf` R6 class.
#
# Two things it is for:
#
#   1. Separating traits from tolerances. The C++ constructor takes 15 positional
#      arguments and four of them -- GSS_tol_abs, ci_abs_tol, ci_niter,
#      vulnerability_curve_ncontrol -- are numerical settings sitting among the
#      physiology. A trait-calibration loop should not have to know which four of
#      the fifteen are not traits. `leaf_traits()` and `leaf_control()` split
#      them -- and four more traits (R_d_25, JS22_gamma, CMax_a, CMax_b) are not
#      constructor arguments at all and have to be assigned afterwards, which is
#      the second thing a caller should not have to know.
#   2. A one-call entry point. `leaf_solve()` takes drivers and returns a
#      data.frame, which is the shape someone reaching for plantecophys expects.

# The C++ default constructor's values, in one place. These are Eucalyptus
# saligna, and they are the defaults for every function below.
#
# ⚠️ These must equal phylloptim::Leaf's default constructor, and it is not enough to
# believe so: tests/testthat/test-golden.R solves through THESE defaults and
# compares bit-exactly against a golden file generated from a default-constructed
# C++ Leaf. If the two ever drift apart, that file fails.
#
# root_c / root_b / root_psi_crit default in MultiLayerRoots rather than in Leaf,
# because a second copy of the root Weibull pair inside Leaf is exactly hazard 1
# in the developer guide -- it has already cost this project a wrong exponent in a
# manuscript draft. They are restated here because the R constructor has to pass
# them, not because Leaf owns them.
#
# beta_R_H / beta_R_V are NOT here since #33: they parameterise the
# root-architecture model, which the leaf no longer runs. Their defaults live with
# that model, on root_network_from_carbon().

##' Physiological traits for a leaf
##'
##' The traits, and only the traits. Numerical settings live in
##' [leaf_control()]; the C++ constructor mixes the two and this is the split.
##'
##' Defaults are *Eucalyptus saligna*, and are the same values
##' `phylloptim::Leaf`'s default constructor uses.
##'
##' @section Two vulnerability curves, not one:
##' `stem_P50`/`stem_c` describe the STEM Weibull curve, which drives the
##' hydraulic cost; `root_P50`/`root_c` describe the ROOT curve, which drives
##' uptake. They are separate parameters with separate meanings and they are
##' named accordingly, because they were once an unmarked `b`/`c` pair alongside
##' `root_b`/`root_c` and an analysis used the root parameters for the stem cost.
##'
##' Each curve has exactly TWO settable numbers. `stem_b`, `psi_crit`, `root_b`
##' and `root_psi_crit` are quantiles of the curve those two define -- readable on
##' the resulting `Leaf` and not settable anywhere. See [weibull_p50_c()].
##'
##' @section psi_crit is not a free trait:
##' `psi_crit` is the stem curve's **P95** and is derived from `stem_P50`/`stem_c`,
##' not set. It used to be settable, describing a curve it was not derived from:
##' the curve is pre-integrated over `[0, P99]`, `psi_crit` never entered that
##' bound, and every solve evaluates the curve *at* `psi_crit` -- so anyone fitting
##' a measured vulnerability curve picked a plausible number and got a domain error
##' naming only the interpolator.
##'
##' At the defaults:
##'
##' ```
##' stem_b = 3.898245, stem_c = 2.680147
##' 3.898245 * log(1/0.05)^(1/2.680147) = 5.870283 = psi_crit
##' ```
##'
##' to six decimal places, against `P99 = 6.891842`. Both move with the pair, so
##' there is nothing left to set inconsistently. `vignette("fitting")` derives the
##' pair from a published P50/P88 pair, which is the right way round.
##'
##' @param vcmax_25 maximum carboxylation rate at 25 C (umol m^-2 s^-1)
##' @param stem_c shape parameter of the stem vulnerability curve (unitless)
##' @param stem_P50 stem potential at 50% loss of conductivity (MPa, positive
##'   magnitude). `stem_b` and `psi_crit` are derived from this pair and are
##'   readable but not settable on the resulting `Leaf`.
##' @param root_c shape parameter of the root vulnerability curve (unitless)
##' @param root_P50 root potential at 50% loss of conductivity (MPa, positive
##'   magnitude), with `root_b` and `root_psi_crit` derived from it.
##' @param TF24_beta2 exponent for the effect of hydraulic risk (unitless)
##' @param jmax_25 maximum electron transport rate at 25 C (umol m^-2 s^-1)
##' @param a quantum yield of photosynthetic electron transport (mol mol^-1)
##' @param curv_fact_elec_trans curvature of the light response curve (unitless)
##' @param curv_fact_colim curvature of the colimited photosynthesis equation
##' @param TF24_cost_scale cost parameter for the TF24 profit model
##'   (umol m^-2 s^-1)
##' @param R_d_25 dark respiration at 25 C (umol m^-2 s^-1). It is the value at
##'   25 C only: respiration rises from there on Tjoelker's declining-Q10 curve.
##' @param JS22_gamma Joshi & Stocker (2022)'s hydraulic unit cost
##'   (umol C m^-2 s^-1 MPa^-2), read only by the `JS22` cost curve and returning
##'   an exactly zero gradient on every other one.
##'
##'   ⚠️ **The default is not a literature value.** It is order-of-magnitude
##'   matched to TF24 at this package's defaults, and no single value matches more
##'   than one soil potential: the `JS22_gamma` reproducing TF24's cost at its own
##'   optimum runs 0.287 at `psi_soil` 0.5 MPa to 1.761 at 3.0 MPa. TF24's cost
##'   tracks the absolute potential and this one tracks the drop, and across a
##'   drydown those move in opposite directions.
##' @param CMax_a,CMax_b slope and intercept of the `CMax` marginal cost,
##'   `dC/dpsi = CMax_a * psi + CMax_b`, following Wolf et al. (2016) as
##'   Anderegg et al. (2018) parameterised it. Read only by the `CMax` curve.
##'
##'   ⚠️ **`CMax_b` is signed, and negative in the source convention.** Sabot's
##'   `TractLSM` stores it with the sign inverted "so as to get a positive
##'   parameter value", so a value taken from that code or from a calibration
##'   against it must have its sign checked rather than assumed.
##'
##'   ⚠️ **Neither default is a literature value.** With `CMax_b = 0` the `CMax_a`
##'   reproducing TF24's cost at its own optimum runs 0.406 at `psi_soil` 0.5 MPa
##'   to 0.807 at 3.0 MPa — a 2.0x range against `JS22_gamma`'s 6.1x, which is the
##'   absolute-versus-drop distinction as a number.
##'
##' @section Where the two root-resistance constants went:
##' `beta_R_H` and `beta_R_V` were traits here until #33. They parameterise the
##' root-ARCHITECTURE model, which the leaf no longer runs -- it takes the
##' resistances. They are arguments to [root_network_from_carbon()] now.
##'
##' The cost is real and worth stating: [leaf_gradient()] can no longer
##' differentiate with respect to either. Perturbing them is cheap, because
##' [root_network_from_carbon()] is homogeneous of degree 1 in each, but the
##' derivative of a solved output still needs two solves either side.

##' Numerical settings for a leaf solve
##'
##' Tolerances and iteration counts. These are not traits: they control how
##' precisely the solve is carried out, not what is being solved, and separating
##' them from [leaf_traits()] is the point of having two functions.
##'
##' @section What is deliberately not here:
##' The internal leaf-temperature clamp (`-40 C` to `70 C`) is a compile-time
##' constant and stays one. It is a guard that keeps an extreme non-equilibrium
##' transpiration on the energy-balance path from driving the Arrhenius block
##' non-finite -- not a tolerance anyone tunes. Making it settable would let a
##' caller produce non-finite photosynthetic parameters and get NaNs back with no
##' indication of why.
##'
##' @param GSS_tol_abs absolute tolerance for a golden-section search over stem
##'   water potential. ⚠️ **This does not set how well the operating point is
##'   determined.** Every solver in the package now root-finds its own first-order
##'   condition instead of searching the objective, so changing this leaves the
##'   answer bit-identical on the production path. What it still does, and it is
##'   less than the name suggests: it is read in exactly two places, both on the
##'   COLLAR route -- the width below which the feasible collar interval is treated
##'   as a single point, and the tolerance of the golden-section FALLBACK used when
##'   neither bracket endpoint has a usable gradient (no driver sweep has reached
##'   that fallback).
##'
##'   ⚠️ **It does not reach the stem route at all.** That refines by a root-find
##'   on `dJ/dpsi == 0` at a hardcoded tolerance; the `(cell width) * 1e-4` figure
##'   is its own golden-section fallback, not its normal path. Tightening this to
##'   sharpen a stem-route argmax does nothing.
##' @param vulnerability_curve_ncontrol number of control points used to
##'   pre-integrate the two Weibull vulnerability curves into splines. Higher is
##'   more accurate and slower to construct; it does not affect solve speed.
##' @param ci_abs_tol absolute tolerance for root-solving intercellular CO2
##' @param ci_niter maximum iterations for root-solving intercellular CO2
##' @param integration_rule accepted and ignored. It selected a Gauss-Kronrod
##'   rule order in plant's compiled quadrature; the header-only adaptive
##'   Simpson that replaced it has no rule order. Retained because plant's R
##'   bindings expose it.
##' @param integration_tol absolute tolerance for the direct quadrature in
##'   `transpiration_full_integration()`. Not on the production path, which
##'   reads the pre-integrated spline instead.

##' Choose how water reaches the root collar
##'
##' Two supply paths, and the choice belongs with the model rather than with the
##' drivers, so it is made once in [leaf_model()].
##'
##' `leaf_supply_multilayer()` is the default and is what plant uses: a soil
##' profile of one or more layers, each with its own water potential, feeding a
##' root network whose resistances are derived from a root carbon profile.
##'
##' `leaf_supply_singlelayer()` collapses the whole soil-to-collar path to **one
##' resistance**. This is what a leaf physiologist arriving from `plantecophys`
##' or `tealeaves` actually has: a soil water potential and no root-mass profile.
##' It is also what makes comparison against other optimality models meaningful,
##' since Medlyn, Prentice least-cost and Cowan-Farquhar are all formulated
##' against a single soil potential — comparing them against a multi-layer root
##' network compares two things at once.
##'
##' @section Both paths are configured the same way, and take the same drivers:
##' Neither function takes a resistance. The soil-to-collar resistance is a
##' per-call **driver** on both paths, supplied to [set_drivers()] as
##' `root_network` — [root_network_from_carbon()] on the multi-layer path,
##' [series_resistance()] on this one. It used to be an argument here, so the same
##' quantity arrived at construction on one path and per call on the other, and
##' `resistance` was the only differentiable parameter whose setter reset the whole
##' object.
##'
##' ⚠️ **`gravity_head` is the one asymmetry left, and it is deliberate.** The
##' multi-layer path derives a per-layer head from the depth profile it is handed
##' (`gravity_head * z_soil_mid`); this path has no depth profile to derive one
##' from, and a bare leaf wants **zero** rather than a geometric default — which is
##' precisely the caller `leaf_supply_singlelayer()` exists for. Making it a driver here
##' would mean either inventing a depth for a leaf that has none, or adding a
##' second supply-shaped argument to [set_drivers()] that only one path reads. If
##' you do want the multi-layer rule for a single layer of thickness `d`, pass
##' `gravity_head = 0.00981 * d / 2`.
##'
##' @section Why this is not a settable field:
##' The obvious R interface would be `leaf$supply_kind <- "single"`. It is not
##' offered, because flipping the tag on its own leaves the other path's state
##' configured and silently ignored, and flipping back makes it stale rather than
##' absent. Both entry points here reconfigure the object completely, so the tag
##' and the supply state can never disagree. The cost is that switching clears
##' the solved state and the drivers must be set again — which is honest, since
##' the two paths read different inputs.
##'
##' @param gravity_head head required to lift water to the collar, MPa. Zero by
##'   default, which is right for a bare leaf that is not thinking about rooting
##'   depth. See the section above for why this, alone, is not a driver.
##'
##' @section The two ends of this path are in different unit bases:
##' \strong{Read this before parameterising a whole soil-to-leaf path}, which is
##' exactly what this supply path is for (#56).

##'
##' - `leaf_specific_conductance_max` is **kg** m^-2 s^-1 MPa^-1
##' - [series_resistance()]'s `resistance` is MPa s **mol**^-1 m^2
##'
##' So the two quantities the package presents as the two ends of one series are on
##' opposite sides of a kg-per-mol factor, and a caller carrying the whole path has to
##' supply it. The calibration study recorded dropping that factor of 0.018 as its
##' original error, **worth three orders of magnitude** — which is why it ended up
##' named in their code rather than inlined.
##'
##' The factor is `molar_mass_h2o` = 0.018015 kg/mol. ⚠️ Nothing here can check you
##' applied it: both quantities are just positive numbers, so a path built on the wrong
##' basis returns a plausible operating point, off by ~55x one way or ~0.018x the other.
##'
##' @return A `leaf_supply` object, for the `supply` argument of [leaf_model()]
##'   and [leaf_solve()].
##' @seealso [series_resistance()] for the resistance itself, which is a driver.
##' @examples
##' # a bare leaf: one soil potential, one resistance, no root profile

##' A single soil-to-collar series resistance, as a supply driver
##'
##' The single-potential path's counterpart to [root_network_from_carbon()]: it
##' packages one series resistance into the [RootNetwork()] that [set_drivers()]
##' takes, so the two supply paths are driven through the same argument.
##'
##' It goes in `r_R_V_sum` rather than `r_R_H_min`, and that is exact rather than a
##' convention: `r_R_V_sum` already means "series resistance from the surface down
##' to this layer, with no vulnerability weighting", and this is that quantity with
##' one layer. `r_R_H_min` is the vulnerability-weighted horizontal term, which
##' this path does not have — supplying a non-zero one is an error rather than
##' ignored, since it would otherwise silently drop a resistance you meant to use.
##'
##' @param resistance the whole soil-to-collar path as one series resistance,
##'   **per unit leaf area**, MPa s (mol H2O)^-1 m^2 leaf. Must be positive: a

# The R-boundary tax on a RootNetwork, and why these two are memoised
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ⚠️ MATERIALISING A RootNetwork AS AN R OBJECT COSTS ~58 us, AND ALMOST NONE OF
# IT IS OUR CODE. Measured against the installed package: `RootNetwork__ctor()` --
# the bare `.Call`, before any R wrapper -- is 58 us, where a trivial `.Call` on a
# Leaf field is 1.1 us and `$set_physiology()` handed a ready-made network is
# 4.3 us. It is `Rcpp::wrap` building the five-element named list, which RcppR6
# generates as five successive `ret["name"] = ...` assignments on an initially
# empty `Rcpp::List` -- each one grows the list and its names attribute.
#
# Building the default network per call therefore made `set_drivers()` **9.4 ->
# 73 us** on the multi-layer path and **5.8 -> 66 us** on the single-potential one,
# and `leaf_solve()` **23.7 -> 108 us/row** -- a 4.5x regression on a figure this
# package's own documentation quotes. Caught only by measuring; every test passed.
#
# This is the R boundary dominating a loop again, which is the standing lesson
# here: count R calls, not arithmetic.
#
# Both memos are deliberately SIZE ONE rather than keyed caches. A `leaf_solve()`
# sweep holds `soil_depth` fixed across rows, so a one-entry memo hits on every row
# after the first, and it cannot grow without bound the way a keyed cache would if
# someone swept the soil profile. The comparison is `identical()` on the depth
# vector -- about 1 us -- not a pasted string key, because formatting a numeric
# vector to build one costs more than it saves.
#
# Sharing one R object across calls is safe: `set_physiology` copies it into C++
# through `Rcpp::as`, nothing mutates it, and R's copy-on-write means a caller who
# got hold of it could not mutate ours either.

.network_memo <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())

# The multi-layer default: 20 kg C m^-2 leaf split evenly over the layers, through
# the architecture model the leaf used to run internally (#33) -- so the numbers
# are the pre-#33 ones and the provenance is on the page rather than buried in a
# signature. `soil_depth` determines the whole thing, because the default carbon is
# `rep(20 / n, n)` with `n == length(soil_depth)`, so it is the only key needed.

# multi-layer default it is a stand-in rather than a recommendation -- but it means
# `leaf_solve(psi_soil = 2, supply = leaf_supply_singlelayer())` means something, exactly
# as it does on the other path. Neither path forces a caller to own a supply model.

##' Set the drivers for a leaf
##'
##' Named and defaulted, over the C++ `set_physiology()`'s ten positional
##' arguments. Modifies `x` in place and returns it invisibly, so it can be
##' piped.
##'
##' @section Water potentials are positive magnitudes:
##' `psi_soil` is a positive number of MPa. There is one representation for water
##' potential throughout this package and it is asserted at the input boundary
##' rather than documented: a negative entry is an error. That check is the only
##' thing standing between a script written against the old signed convention and
##' a plausible wrong number, so this wrapper surfaces it rather than smoothing
##' it over -- it does not take `abs()`.
##'
##' @section Multiple soil layers:
##' Pass vectors for `psi_soil`, and optionally for `soil_depth`. Both must end up
##' the same length; by default `soil_depth` becomes 1 m layers.
##'
##' @section The supply resistances, on either path:
##' The leaf takes the soil-to-collar hydraulic RESISTANCES, not the root carbon
##' they may have been derived from (#33). The solve reads two vectors of them,
##' `r_R_H_min` and `r_R_V_sum`, and nothing in it knows about root carbon, layer
##' thickness, the 1/3 : 2/3 vertical/horizontal split or either `beta_R_*`
##' constant. This function used to ask for a root carbon profile, which a leaf
##' physiologist does not have, and invented a default of 20 kg C m^-2 leaf.
##'
##' **`root_network` is the same argument on both supply paths**, which is the
##' point. On the multi-layer path it carries one `r_R_H_min` and one `r_R_V_sum`
##' per rooted layer; on the single-potential path it carries one series resistance
##' in `r_R_V_sum` and nothing else, which is that field's own meaning with one
##' layer and no vulnerability-weighted term. [root_network_from_carbon()] builds
##' the first, [series_resistance()] the second. Before this change the
##' single-potential resistance was an argument to [leaf_supply_singlelayer()] instead —
##' so the same quantity arrived at a different *time* depending on which path was
##' in force, and it was the only fitted parameter whose setter reset the object.
##'
##' Both paths default it, because neither should force a caller to own a supply
##' model they do not have, and both defaults are written out in this function's
##' body rather than buried in a signature: a nominal 20 kg C m^-2 leaf through
##' [root_network_from_carbon()] on the multi-layer path, and a nominal 1e3
##' MPa s (mol H2O)^-1 m^2 leaf series resistance on the single-potential one.
##' Both are stand-ins, not recommendations.
##'
##' `soil_depth` is the one argument that is genuinely multi-layer-only, and
##' passing it on the single-potential path is an error rather than ignored: there
##' is no depth profile there for anything to read. That is also why
##' [leaf_supply_singlelayer()] keeps `gravity_head` — see its documentation for the one
##' remaining asymmetry between the two paths, and why it is left in place.

##'   from [root_network_from_carbon()] on the multi-layer path, or one series

##'
##' Costs about 4 µs, so it is usable in a loop. It was 180 µs until it stopped

##'
##' `hydraulic_cost` is the whole cost the objective subtracted. `shadow_cost` is

##' later. So
##'
##' \preformatted{
##'   realised cost   = hydraulic_cost - shadow_cost
##'   carbon profit   = profit + shadow_cost
##' }
##'
##' and a consumer that grows a plant on this leaf wants the second of those,
##' never `profit`. Deducting a shadow price from a carbon budget taxes growth by
##' something the plant never spent.
##'
##' `shadow_cost` is `TF24_floor_lambda_o * E` on that curve and zero on every
##' other. Zero means *this curve does not separate the two*, not *this curve's
##' cost is all realised carbon*. `CF77` is the case worth stating: its whole cost
##' is `lambda * E`, and reading that as a shadow price is an ordinary thing to do,
##' but the model supplies one number and nothing to attribute it with and behaves
##' identically whichever way it is read. Reporting it as all-shadow would present
##' one reading as a fact. The field is defined only where the curve defines it.

##' boundary: each call into C++ costs ~1.1 µs and a solved row needs several.
##'
##' Two consequences, both the opposite of what you might expect:
##'
##' * **This is the fast path, not the convenient-but-slow one.** It is within 6%
##'   of building a `Leaf` yourself and looping `set_drivers()` +
##'   `$find_root_collar_psi()` + [operating_point()]. Reaching into the object
##'   saves about 1 µs a row and is worth doing for access to intermediate state,
##'   not for speed. (This was not true before: building the result row by row and
##'   `rbind`ing cost 344 µs a row, 26× the stateful loop.)
##' * **The lever is fewer R calls per row, not a different R function.** Pass all
##'   your drivers to one vectorised call rather than looping in R. If you need
##'   more than that -- a fit's inner loop, say -- what has to go is the boundary
##'   itself, which means C++.
##'
##' `reuse = TRUE` is the default because constructing a `Leaf` from R costs
##' about **180x a trivial `.Call`** (~230 µs where this was measured), or 45
##' solves, and only ~32 µs of that is the two vulnerability
##' splines; the rest is R-side object construction. See [set_traits()] for
##' varying traits without reconstructing, and note it costs 21.8 µs rather than
##' 0.02 µs when the trait you change owns a vulnerability spline.
##'
##' @section Recycling:
##' `PPFD`, `atm_vpd`, `ca`, `leaf_temp`, `atm_o2_kpa`, `atm_kpa` and
##' `leaf_specific_conductance_max` are recycled to a common length, the usual R
##' way. `psi_soil` is recycled too **when it is a plain numeric vector** --
##' each element is then a separate single-layer solve. For multi-layer solves
##' pass a list of numeric vectors, one per row; `soil_depth` follows the same
##' rule. `root_network` is either one [RootNetwork()], used for every row, or a
##' list of them, one per row.
##'
##' @inheritParams set_drivers
##' @param traits a [leaf_traits()] object
##' @param control a [leaf_control()] object
##' @param supply how water reaches the root collar: [leaf_supply_multilayer()]
##'   (the default) or [leaf_supply_singlelayer()]. On the single-potential path
##'   `soil_depth` and `root_network` must be omitted, and each `psi_soil` is one
##'   value rather than a profile.
##' @param model which optimality model to solve, as in [leaf_gradient()]:
##'   `"collar"` (the default, the production path -- the TF24 cost maximised over
##'   the root-collar potential) or any name from [cost_curve_names()], which
##'   solves that curve's **stem** optimum instead: `psi_stem` with the upstream
##'   potential pinned at `psi_soil`, which needs `leaf_supply_singlelayer()`.
##'
##'   ⚠️ **`"collar"` and `"TF24"` are different models, not two ways of asking
##'   one question**, even though both use the TF24 cost. They optimise different
##'   variables over different supply topologies and disagree on 20 of 30 driver
##'   rows.
##'
##'   ⚠️ **On a stem route the `collar` column comes back non-finite**, because
##'   the collar is not solved for at all. An absent number is the truthful answer
##'   rather than a gap -- reading one would be reading whatever the last solve
##'   left behind.
##'
##'   Two curves take a PRESCRIBED price of water rather than deriving one:
##'   `CF77` reads `CF77_lambda` and `TF24_floor` reads `TF24_floor_lambda_o`,
##'   both below. Neither has a default, and each curve refuses to solve without
##'   its own.
##' @param CF77_lambda,TF24_floor_lambda_o the prescribed marginal value of water
##'   for the two curves that take one, in umol C (kg H2O)^-1. `NA_real_` (the
##'   default) leaves the field unset, which every other model wants.
##'
##'   ⚠️ **Their scale is set by the leaf, not chosen freely.** At this package's
##'   defaults the leaf's own marginal cost of water runs 9e4 to 3e5, and a price
##'   far outside that band pins the optimum against a bound — where the answer
##'   describes the bracket rather than the model. [operating_point()]'s
##'   `lambda_emergent` is how you find a value that means something.
##' @param reuse solve every row with one `Leaf` object (`TRUE`) or construct a
##'   fresh one per row (`FALSE`, the default). Reuse is faster because the two
##'   vulnerability splines are built once, and it is safe -- every exit from the
##'   solve writes its own outputs. `FALSE` exists so that can be checked rather
##'   than assumed, and the package's tests do check it.
##'
##' @return A data.frame with one row per driver combination: the drivers, then
##'   the columns of [operating_point()].
##' @seealso [leaf_model()] for the stateful interface.
