# Developer entry points. Same shape as plant's and odelia's Makefiles, plus the
# targets this package needs that they do not: it has both an R layer and a C++
# core that must keep building without R (PLAN item 6a).
#
# The split worth knowing before you pick a target:
#
#   make test        the R layer. Needs R.
#   make test-cpp    the model, as plain C++. Needs no R.
#   make test-cmake  the model again, through the route a C++ or Python
#                    consumer takes, including install and find_package.
#
# `make check-all` runs all three, and is what to run before pushing.

# --- generated code ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# inst/RcppR6_classes.yml is the source of truth for the R bindings. Edit that,
# then run this -- never edit R/RcppR6.R, src/RcppR6.cpp or
# inst/include/phylloptim/RcppR6_*.hpp, which all carry a "do not edit by hand" banner.
# The generated files are committed, so a consumer never needs RcppR6; CI
# regenerates and diffs to catch a commit that forgot to.

# The model as plain C++: no R, no Rcpp, no test framework. This is the
# regression baseline, and it is blind to the R layer -- tests/testthat/ ties the
# R side back to the same golden points.
#
# `bench` is built too, because it is NOT part of `make -C tests/cpp` and CI
# builds it: a rename that misses bench_solve.cpp gives a green local run and
# three red CI jobs.

# Covers three things the Makefile above cannot: that the install rules ship the
# right headers and exclude the Rcpp-dependent ones, that find_package produces a
# usable target, and that none of it needs R.
#
# odelia is not findable by CMake, so point at a checkout. A sibling one is the
# default, which is the layout of the plant-family tree.
