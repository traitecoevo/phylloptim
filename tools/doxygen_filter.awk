# Present leaf's plain `//` comments to Doxygen as documentation, without
# touching a single source file.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Doxygen only treats `///`, `//!`, `/** */` and `/*! */` as
# documentation; an ordinary `//` comment is invisible to it. Every comment in
# this package is an ordinary `//` comment, and they are the substantive part --
# the FMA-contraction note in `hydraulic_cost_Sperry`, the four "do not get this
# wrong" warnings in closed_form.hpp, the two-vulnerability-curves hazard at the
# `stem_b`/`stem_c` declarations. Rendering the API without them would render the
# half a reader can already get from the signatures.
#
# The alternative -- rewriting `//` to `///` across ten headers -- is a large
# diff through exactly the files that feature/api-cleanup (PR #15) rewrites, for
# a cosmetic gain. Doing it at render time costs nothing and conflicts with
# nothing.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. Four rules:
#
#   1. PASS THROUGH the `-*-c++-*-` modeline (an Emacs directive, not prose) and
#      anything already written as `///` or `//!` (a deliberate Doxygen comment,
#      which needs no help and must not be double-marked).
#
#   2. The FIRST comment block in a file becomes a `\file` block, so the "why
#      this header exists" preamble lands on the file's own page instead of being
#      attached to whichever declaration happens to follow it.
#
#   3. Every later line-leading `//` becomes `///`. Trailing comments
#      (`double x; // note`) are left alone: Doxygen would attach them to the
#      wrong entity, and they are terse anyway.
#
#   4. INDENTED RUNS BECOME `\verbatim`. This matters more than it sounds. These
#      comments are full of indented ASCII tables, benchmark numbers and usage
#      examples, and Markdown reflows anything indented by less than four spaces
#      into a paragraph -- turning the usage example at the top of leaf.hpp into
#      one unreadable line. A run of lines indented relative to the surrounding
#      prose is reproduced exactly instead.
#
#      A run only OPENS after a blank line and only on a line that is not a list
#      item. Both conditions are load-bearing. Without the first, the hanging
#      indent under a bullet (`  * POSITIVE magnitudes -- ...` followed by
#      four-space continuations, all over leaf_model.hpp) is mistaken for a code
#      block; that produced a real "'\verbatim' command is not allowed in section
#      title" error before the condition was added. Without the second, the
#      bulleted and numbered lists that DO follow a blank line become
#      preformatted text and stop rendering as lists.
#
# ESCAPING. Text outside a verbatim run is escaped, because none of it was
# written with Doxygen in mind: `\`, `@`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `<` and `>` all mean
# something to Doxygen and here they never do. Without it, `#include <leaf.hpp>`
# becomes a broken link to an entity called "include" followed by a swallowed
# HTML tag, and the `\int` in the roots.hpp head-loss note becomes an unknown
# command; both were observed before this was added. Verbatim runs are NOT
# escaped -- Doxygen reproduces them literally, so an escape would show up as a
# stray backslash. If you genuinely want a Doxygen command, write a `///`
# comment and rule 1 will leave it alone.
#
# Deliberately POSIX awk -- no gawk-only `match(s, re, arr)` -- because CI runs
# this on ubuntu, where /usr/bin/awk is mawk.
#
# Usage (see Doxyfile): INPUT_FILTER = "awk -f tools/doxygen_filter.awk"
