# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is not "because the other golden file does".
# `test-gradient-batch.R` compares the C++ composite against `leaf_gradient()`
# bit-for-bit, and that is the strong test of the transcription -- the two share
# no code. What it cannot see is a change applied CONSISTENTLY TO BOTH: move the
# step rule, the active-set threshold or a solver tolerance and the two
# implementations move together, the equality test passes, and nothing anywhere
# says the gradients changed. That is the trap #70 hit inside R alone, and it
# would be far easier to hit across a language boundary. So the values are also
# pinned to a file.
#
# ⚠️ HEX FLOATS, and do not "tidy" them into decimals. R's decimal
# string-to-double conversion is not correctly rounded: on a random sample about
# 18% of full-precision inputs come back one ULP away. R reads C99 hex exactly.
# That is issue #13, where a supposed 1-ULP disagreement with plant turned out to
# be entirely the measuring instrument.
#
# ⚠️ Only regenerate DELIBERATELY, and say in the commit message what moved and by
# how much. Running this after an accidental change rubber-stamps it. The guide to
# magnitudes is in .claude/CLAUDE.md: ~1e-16 is reassociation, ~1e-9 is the
# solver floor, ~1e-4 is a real difference.
#
# ⚠️ RUN THIS ON macOS/arm64 AND NOWHERE ELSE. Like tests/cpp/golden/, the file is
# bit-exact only on the platform that generated it -- libm's exp/pow are not
# bit-reproducible between glibc on x86-64 and Apple's libm on arm64 -- and
# test-gradient-batch.R compares with `golden_tolerance()` elsewhere. Regenerating
# on Linux would just move the failure to the platform the file came from.
#
# These are derivatives of outputs evaluated at the ARGMAX of a flat maximum, so
# they inherit that file's sqrt-amplified class -- and, being finite differences,
# one amplification more. Measured worst cross-platform disagreement 1.3e-3,
# against 1.4e-4 for the solved outputs themselves. A central difference cancels
# the systematic part of a libm difference, not all of it, and what is left is
# divided by the step: the smallest-magnitude parameter in the file therefore sets
# the tolerance for all of it, which since #41 is `R_d_25` at 1.44 rather than
# `vcmax_25` at 96. `gradient_golden_tolerance()` in tests/testthat/helper-golden.R
# carries the arithmetic.
suppressMessages(library(phylloptim))

# ⚠️ AND SAY WHICH BUILD THAT WAS. `library(phylloptim)` resolves against the
# library path, NOT against the tree you are standing in, so running this from a
# working tree with uninstalled changes regenerates the file from the SITE build --
# reproducing the values you were trying to replace, exactly, with no warning. That
# is not hypothetical: it happened while regenerating for #92 and reported "0 cells
# moved" against a suite that was failing on 63 of them. It is the same trap
# `tools/bench_history.sh` guards with --expect-version, and the same one the guide
# records for plant under "Validating against plant".
#
# So the path goes to stderr on every run, where it does not corrupt the TSV on
# stdout. Check it before believing the diff:
#
#   R CMD INSTALL --library=/tmp/lib . && \
#     R_LIBS=/tmp/lib Rscript tools/gradient_golden.R > tests/testthat/gradient_golden.tsv
# The check compares the INSTALLED HEADERS against this tree's, which is the actual
# question. `R CMD INSTALL` copies `inst/include/` into the package directory, so
# `system.file("include", ...)` is a verbatim copy of the headers the loaded build
# was compiled from -- comparing paths cannot work (an installed package is never
# in the working tree) and comparing versions cannot either, since the version is
# rarely bumped for a numerics change.
