# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is not "because the other golden file does".
# `test-gradient-batch.R` compares the C++ composite against `leaf_gradient()`
# bit-for-bit, and that is the strong test of the transcription -- the two share
# no code. What it cannot see is a change applied CONSISTENTLY TO BOTH: move the
# step rule, the active-set threshold or a solver tolerance and the two
# implementations move together, the equality test passes, and nothing anywhere
# says the gradients changed. That is the trap #70 hit inside R alone, and it
# would be far easier to hit across a language boundary. So the values are also
# pinned to a file.
#
# ⚠️ HEX FLOATS, and do not "tidy" them into decimals. R's decimal
# string-to-double conversion is not correctly rounded: on a random sample about
# 18% of full-precision inputs come back one ULP away. R reads C99 hex exactly.
# That is issue #13, where a supposed 1-ULP disagreement with plant turned out to
# be entirely the measuring instrument.
#
# ⚠️ Only regenerate DELIBERATELY, and say in the commit message what moved and by
# how much. Running this after an accidental change rubber-stamps it. The guide to
# magnitudes is in .claude/CLAUDE.md: ~1e-16 is reassociation, ~1e-9 is the
# solver floor, ~1e-4 is a real difference.
#
# ⚠️ RUN THIS ON macOS/arm64 AND NOWHERE ELSE. Like tests/cpp/golden/, the file is
# bit-exact only on the platform that generated it -- libm's exp/pow are not
# bit-reproducible between glibc on x86-64 and Apple's libm on arm64 -- and
# test-gradient-batch.R compares with `golden_tolerance()` elsewhere. Regenerating
# on Linux would just move the failure to the platform the file came from.
#
# These are derivatives of outputs evaluated at the ARGMAX of a flat maximum, so
# they inherit that file's sqrt-amplified class: measured worst cross-platform
# disagreement 1.3e-4, against 1.4e-4 for the same class of solved outputs. A
# central difference cancels the systematic part of a libm difference, not all of
# it.
