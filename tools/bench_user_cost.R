# What a user pays, on the R side, for the three things a calibration actually does:
# one solve, N solves, and a gradient. The C++ side of the same three lives in
# tests/cpp/bench_solve.cpp and tests/cpp/bench_gradient.cpp; tools/bench_history.sh
# runs both and puts them in one table.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The package asserts no absolute timings anywhere else, on the
# grounds that they are machine-dependent -- and that is exactly how a 4.5x
# regression in `set_drivers()` reached a green CI. Every test passed, `R CMD check`
# passed, and nothing looked at the clock.
#
# ⚠️ THE RECORDED QUANTITY IS A RATIO, NOT MICROSECONDS. The same build measured an
# hour apart on this machine moved a bare `.Call` from 0.69 to 1.10 us. What is
# stable across machines and runs is a cost DIVIDED BY the cost of a trivial `.Call`
# in the same process, so that is what is compared. Absolute figures are printed for
# orientation; never pin one.
#
# VERSION-AWARE on purpose -- it is meant to run against older commits in a
# worktree, and the driver API changed twice (#63 root carbon -> resistances, #66 the
# single path's resistance -> a driver). It detects the surface rather than assuming.
