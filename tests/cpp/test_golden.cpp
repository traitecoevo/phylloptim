// Why this exists. The refactors in PLAN.md items 7-11 are meant to be
// behaviour-preserving, and the only way to know is to pin the behaviour first.
// PLAN.md item 1 -- cross-checking against plant's compiled build -- is the real
// validation, and it is DONE: the swap was bit-identical, including 78 of 78 SCM
// nodes. This file is the cheaper, always-available version: it freezes what THIS
// implementation produces so that a
// refactor which changes any of it fails loudly.
//
// Comparison is bit-exact by default. Values are written with %.17g, which
// round-trips an IEEE double exactly, so a passing run means the refactor did not
// perturb a single floating-point operation. If a change is *meant* to alter
// results, regenerate deliberately and say so in the commit.
//
// Bit-exactness holds on the platform that generated the file (macOS/arm64) and
// cannot hold on any other -- `--rtol` is for those. See the comment above main().
//
// Note: a fresh Leaf is constructed for every grid point. That is not for tidiness
// -- it WAS required, because the shutdown-state leak (PLAN.md item 2) made a
// reused Leaf order-dependent, which would have made this file ill-defined. That
// leak is fixed, so the construction is now belt-and-braces rather than load
// bearing -- and it is kept, because a fresh Leaf per point is also what makes
// this file blind to stale state by construction (hazard 8).

// The classification of the grid, by count
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `Leaf::operating_point_kind()` says which branch of the collar solve produced
// the point, and the grid's split between those branches is already an
// established number AT 25 C: 240 of those 288 points are feasible, of which 198 sit
// at an interior profit maximum and 42 at a constrained optimum pinned to a bracket
// bound (24 wet, 18 dry); the remaining 48 shut down. Those figures are quoted in
// the developer guide and in maximise_profit_over_collar's own comment. The 40 C
// counts were measured when the axis was added.
//
// So this asserts the classification against numbers that already exist rather
// than inventing reference values for it. It is a cheap test with a specific
// job: the tag must come from the branch that was TAKEN, and a plausible-looking
// wrong implementation -- classifying by |dprofit| against a tolerance -- would
// not reproduce this split, because dprofit's shut-down sentinel is exactly 0.0
// and would move all 48 shutdown points into `interior`.
//
// Three kinds are expected to be EMPTY here: `shade-death` because assim_max_ never
// gets there (it is reached by light, not by drying, and not by heat either at 40 C);
// `solver-refused` and `non-finite-gradient` because both bracket endpoints admit a
// usable gradient on every feasible row.
//
// ⚠️ The hot end does NOT reach the compensation-point exit either, which is worth
// knowing before reading the zeros as coverage: at the defaults that needs about
// 45 C. `test_rd_temperature_response` covers it.
//
// A zero counts for this grid, whose psi_soil values are {0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6},
// and says nothing about the model. What the two failure branches do is checked
// by test_collar_solve_refuses_rather_than_guessing in test_leaf.cpp.

// points move between branches as the leaf warms and still add up.

// WHY A SECOND FILE. `operating_points.tsv` above solves with
// `find_root_collar_psi()` and nothing else, so it is blind BY CONSTRUCTION to
// the three `optimise_psi_stem_*` entry points -- and so is the R suite, whose
// 112 test_that blocks call none of them. Every existing C++ test that touches
// them asserts a RELATION (a first-order condition, a monotonicity, a thrown
// message) at spot-checked settings; not one records a number. So today it is
// possible to detect that a refactor broke a relation, and impossible to say
// what it changed.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE RECORDS TODAY'S BEHAVIOUR, INCLUDING ITS KNOWN DEFECTS, ON
// PURPOSE. Do not read a row as a statement about what the model SHOULD do.
// Specifically recorded here as-is:
//   * two different degenerate conventions -- `_TF` and `_CowanFarquhar`
//     evaluate the real objective at the closed point, `_ProfitMax` zeroes seven
//     fields instead;
//   * `hydraulic_cost_` written in carbon units by `_TF` and `_CowanFarquhar`
//     and left STALE by `_ProfitMax`, which does not write it;
//   * `lambda_` as a caller input that `_ProfitMax` overwrites.
//
// ⚠️ ADDING A SOLVER IS AN ADDITION IN THE "fresh" PASS AND NOT IN THE "reuse"
// ONE, so check the two separately when regenerating. The reuse pass drives one
// Leaf through a fixed SEQUENCE, so inserting a solver changes what every solver
// after it inherits. Adding Cowan-Farquhar moved 232 reuse rows and zero fresh
// rows, and every one of those 232 moved in the `lambda` column alone: it writes
// `lambda_`, so the solvers that follow it and do not write one report its value
// instead of the previous solver's. That is the leak this pass exists to catch,
// not a defect in the new model -- but it means "regenerated and the diff is
// pure addition" is the wrong check here. The right one is: the fresh pass is
// additive, and every reuse-pass difference is attributable to a named cause.
//
// TWO PASSES, and the second is the one the file exists for. Pass "fresh"
// constructs a Leaf per row, which makes it reproducible and blind to stale
// state -- the same trade the grid above makes. Pass "reuse" drives ONE Leaf
// through a fixed sequence of rows, poisoning every stale-prone output first, so
// a value that survives is provably not written by the path under test. Four of
// the divergences above are stale-state bugs that pass "fresh" cannot see.

// Usage:
//   test_golden                   bit-exact. The default, and the mode that
//                                 matters on the platform that generated the file.
//   test_golden --cross-platform  per-field tolerances, for any OTHER platform.
//   test_golden --generate        overwrite the golden file (see the warning above).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why a cross-platform mode is needed, and why it is per-field
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The golden file is a *drift* detector: it pins what this implementation
// produces so that a refactor which perturbs it fails loudly. That needs
// bit-exactness, and gets it, on the platform that generated the file
// (macOS/arm64).
//
// It cannot be bit-exact anywhere else, and never could have been. libm's
// exp/pow are not bit-reproducible between glibc on x86-64 and Apple's libm on
// arm64, and FMA contraction differs too. Regenerating the file on a second
// platform is NOT the fix -- it just moves the failure to the first one.
//
// The interesting part is the SIZE of the disagreement, because it is not one
// number. Read off this program's own summary line on Linux CI, the nine reported
// fields split into two classes five orders of magnitude apart, and gcc and clang
// agree exactly:
//
//                                   gcc        clang
//     profit                        2.14e-09   2.14e-09
//     psi_stem, collar, ci, assim,
//     transpiration, gc, e_up,
//     uptake                        1.4e-04    1.4e-04
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING ASSERTS THAT BLOCK, so it rots in silence -- it has been wrong three
// times. **If you need a magnitude, read the summary line, not this comment and not
// the FAIL lines**: the failure list is truncated at 20 and biased toward whichever
// rows come first.
//
// That split is structural, not luck. `find_root_collar_psi` maximises profit
// over the collar potential, and the maximum is FLAT: curvature k measured
// directly at the two worst operating points gives k = 1.0 and 0.9 in
// profit ~ p* - k(psi_stem - x*)^2. For a flat maximum, an error dp in the
// profit VALUE displaces the ARGMAX by sqrt(dp/k), which is why a
// well-conditioned profit sits three orders below an ill-conditioned argmax.
//
// The relation was checked pointwise, not as a global identity: at the two worst
// points the residuals imply k = 1.01 and 1.70, against the 1.0 and 0.9 measured
// from the curvature directly. Do NOT expect sqrt(worst profit) to equal the
// worst argmax difference -- the two maxima occur at different operating points.
//
// Two consequences worth keeping in mind beyond this file:
//
//   * profit is the only reported field that is well-conditioned across
//     platforms, because it is the maximum itself rather than its location.
//   * 8 of the 9 fields are pinned to 17 digits but only *determined* to about
//     GSS_tol_abs (1e-3). Bit-exactness on one platform still works as a drift
//     detector -- any code change moves the arbitrary choice within that window,
//     and that shows up -- but it is reproducibility, not determinacy.
//
// So the tolerances below are per class, with the measured worst case and
// headroom noted at their definition. Both are far below the ~1e-4-and-up scale
// at which a real behavioural change shows (PLAN.md item 1), except that for the
// argmax fields the noise floor IS that scale -- which is exactly why the mode
// reports the worst value per class on every run rather than only on failure.
