// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why this exists, when golden/operating_points.tsv already does
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// That file compares the SOLVE. This one compares the functions the solve calls,
// and the difference is localisation. The nested solvers amplify a perturbation up
// to whichever tolerance is loosest, so by the time a last-bit difference reaches a
// reported output it has been through a collar root-find and a ci iteration and no
// longer points anywhere. The operating-point file can say "3496 cells moved"; it
// cannot say which function moved them.
//
// This is issue #64's option 2, and it is filed there with the two occasions that
// made the case. Both were #92, the vulnerability-domain fix:
//
//   * The DEFECT was invisible to the operating-point file. The knot grid dropped
//     its last knot at the package defaults for years -- 99 knots ending at 6.8229
//     against a psi_max of 6.8918, one full step short -- and the golden file
//     recorded the consequences as the correct answer. Only comparing the realised
//     domain against vulnerability_psi_max finds that, which is a primitive-level
//     check.
//   * The FIX's blast radius could not be attributed from it either. Deciding
//     whether 3496 moved cells were a knot displacement (~1e-15) or the added knot
//     needed a standalone program over the primitives, written in a scratch
//     directory and thrown away. Twice.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What the reference is, which is the question #64 treats as the blocker
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A checked-in table of primitive values, generated deliberately from this
// implementation and compared bit-exactly thereafter. Its authority comes from
// exactly where operating_points.tsv's does.
//
// It is NOT a comparison against plant, and it cannot be: plant has no independent
// copy of this model any more, it consumes these headers, so "compare against
// plant" would be comparing this file with itself. The two `compare_*.R` harnesses
// that did compare against plant are deleted rather than revived, for that reason.
// What they established -- bit-identical, including 78 of 78 SCM nodes -- is
// recorded in PLAN.md item 1 and cannot be re-run.
//
// ⚠️ ONE THING THE ORIGINAL HARNESS NEEDED AND THIS DOES NOT: hex floats. It emitted
// every value twice, decimal and `%a`, because its counterpart read the file into R
// and R's decimal parser is not correctly rounded -- `as.numeric`, `scan` and
// `read.delim` all return a double one ULP off for about 18% of inputs, which
// manufactures exactly the disagreement it was built to explain. Both sides here are
// C++ and the reader is `strtod`, which IS correctly rounded, so `%.17g` round-trips
// exactly. Do not "restore" the hex column: it would be a second representation of
// the same number for no reader.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Tiers, and why they are the whole design
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Rows are emitted in CALL-TREE order: pure arithmetic first, then things that call
// it. So the FIRST tier that disagrees is the answer, and the tiers below it are
// consequences rather than clues. That is the method the dead harness encoded and
// the reason #64 judged it worth reviving rather than deleting.
//
// The tolerant mode reports the worst deviation PER TIER on every run, not one
// number for the file. A cross-platform diff that is 1e-16 in tier 1 and 1e-4 in
// tier 5 is libm plus solver amplification and is expected; the same 1e-4 appearing
// in tier 1 is a real change in the arithmetic. One pooled figure cannot make that
// distinction, which is the thing operating_points.tsv cannot do.

// cross-platform table that has been wrong three times because a reading was
// written down as a fact. Tier 1 is libm's exp/pow alone, which disagrees between
// glibc/x86-64 and Apple's libm at a few ULP; every tier above inherits that and
// adds its own amplification, and tier 5 additionally carries a root-find whose own
// tolerance is 1e-10. Each ceiling is orders above what that implies, so a failure
// here is a real change rather than a tight bound being grazed.
//
// The REAL figures come from this program's own summary line, which prints on every
// tolerant run whether or not it passes -- never from the FAIL list, which is
// truncated at 20 and biased toward whichever rows come first.
//
// FIRST READING, ubuntu-latest against a macOS/arm64 file, one CI run, and labelled
// as a reading rather than promoted to a fact:
//
//     tier            g++        clang++    ceiling    worst row
//     arithmetic      3.97e-15   4.21e-15   1e-13      peak_arrh_curve(96, 45)
//     vulnerability   7.01e-16   7.01e-16   1e-12      cumulative_..._at(4.1351, 3.9)
//     assimilation    1.75e-15   1.75e-15   1e-11      assim_colimited(7)
//     spline          3.07e-14   3.07e-14   1e-10      stem_curve_integral_deriv(3.75)
//     iterative       8.01e-11   8.01e-11   1e-6       psi_stem_to_ci(2.75)
//
// The two compilers agree on four tiers exactly and differ only in tier 1, at the
// same operating point -- so what is being measured is the platform's libm, not the
// compiler, which is the same conclusion test_golden reached.
//
// ⚠️ READ THE SHAPE, NOT JUST THE SIZES, because the shape is the result. Four tiers
// sit at 1e-14 to 1e-16 -- libm and FMA contraction, nothing else -- and the
// iterative tier sits three orders higher at 8.01e-11, which is `psi_stem_to_ci`'s
// own 1e-10 tolerance showing through. So the 1.4e-04 that operating_points.tsv
// reports for its argmax-derived fields is NOT present in the primitives at all: it
// is amplification by the solve, and this file is what establishes that rather than
// assuming it.
//
// The ceilings are deliberately NOT tightened to these numbers yet. One run on one
// runner image is not a distribution, and a bound set to the first reading fails on
// the second. Tighten when several agree.
