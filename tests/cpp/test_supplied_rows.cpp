// The row the leaf hands over as a number, against a difference of the forward
// model that produces it.
//
// A supplied row is supplied onto a value, so every consumer downstream reads it
// without recomputing it -- and a difference of anything downstream returns
// IDENTICALLY ZERO on the column it occupies, right, wrong or absent. The only
// place it can be caught is here, where the function it claims to be the
// derivative of can still be evaluated at two points.
//
// ONE row is supplied on this surface now:
//
//   duptake_dp[j]   d(uptake_j)/d(collar), from roots_.duptake_dpsi.
//                   supply_draw_at takes the draw at a PASSIVE collar and
//                   supplies this row beside it, so the tape never sees a
//                   layer's uptake move with the collar. outputs_at closed-form rows it
//                   as `uptake[j] + duptake_dp[j] * step`.
//
// ⚠️ THE AGGREGATE IS NOT THE ROWS. duptake_dpsi's total is refereed against a
// difference of uptake_at elsewhere, and it passed at 6e-12 while a per-layer
// term could still be wrong in a way the sum hides -- two layers off by equal and
// opposite amounts cancel exactly. Each layer is differenced separately here for
// that reason.
//
// ⚠️ THE ROWS ARE IN MOL AND THE AGGREGATE IS IN KG. Their sum times
// kg_per_mol_h2o is the total, and asserting that is what caught the dropped
// constant once: every per-layer value stayed exact and only the aggregate moved.
//
// ⚠️ dM/dp IS NO LONGER A SUPPLIED ROW and is not checked here. It is a central
// difference of the model's own marginal, so differencing it against the model
// would compare a difference with itself. The conditioning measurement that made
// it a difference is at marginal_collar_slope.
//
// ⚠️ THE BUDGET IS WHAT THE DIFFERENCE CAN SEE. A central difference cannot
// resolve arbitrarily small numbers, so each row is differenced at TWO steps and
// the gap between those answers is the floor for that row. A check held tighter
// than its own reference's noise is measuring the step size.
//
// Run by `make -C tests/cpp`, with the rest of the suite.
