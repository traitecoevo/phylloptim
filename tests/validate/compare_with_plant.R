# PLAN.md item 1: cross-check this package against plant's compiled build.
#
#   Rscript tests/validate/compare_with_plant.R
#
# Runs plant's own `Leaf` -- the compiled class in the installed plant package,
# not a reimplementation -- over exactly the grid in tests/cpp/test_golden.cpp,
# and compares against the golden file this package generated.
#
# RESULT AS OF 2026-08-03: the finite values are BIT-IDENTICAL to plant, all 2352
# of them. Zero difference, not a small one.
#
# This retracts the previous result rather than editing it, because the previous
# result was an artifact of this script. It reported '585 of 2592 differ, every
# one at 1-2 ULP, cause unknown'. That decomposes exactly:
#
#     345   R's decimal parser reading the golden file
#     240   the shutdown-state NA sentinel (48 rows x 5 flux fields)
#     ---
#     585
#
# THE 345. R's string-to-double conversion is not correctly rounded. as.numeric,
# scan and read.delim all share it, and it returns a double one ULP off the
# correctly rounded value for about 18% of inputs:
#
#     "26.550866314209998"   R gives 0x1.a8d0593240001p+4
#                            correct  0x1.a8d059324p+4
#
# The golden file is written by C++ at full %.17g precision and read into R;
# plant's values are computed in-process and never touch a string. So the parser
# perturbed one side and not the other, and the script attributed the result to
# the two implementations. It now reads through tests/validate/tsv_to_hex.c,
# which parses with the C library's strtod and re-emits hex, which R reads
# exactly. Verified: 4000 of 4000 hex values round-trip, against 3265 of 4000
# for %.17g.
#
# This also explains why every previous hypothesis was ruled out and nothing
# replaced them -- plant version, compiler flags, -ffp-contract, inlining, odelia
# header version, translation-unit structure. None of them was ever involved. It
# is also why scm_regression.R found the consume build bit-identical: that
# comparison never round-trips through a text file parsed by R.
#
# THE 240 are not arithmetic at all: golden carries the NA sentinel on shutdown
# rows where plant carries a number, because set_shutdown_state assigns
# opt_root_psi_ (root_collar_psi_ before #25), opt_psi_stem_ and profit_ and leaves
# ci/assim/transpiration/
# gc/e_up untouched. That WAS the shutdown-state leak (PLAN item 2, plant #578),
# and the count matches the 48 x 5 recorded as that fix's blast radius. The leak is
# fixed both here and in plant, so this column should now be empty against a
# current plant -- it is retained because a non-empty one means the two have
# drifted apart again, which is more useful than the check disappearing.
#
# Corroborated independently by compare_primitives.R, which calls the underlying
# functions directly -- arrh_curve, the vulnerability curve, the assimilation
# terms, transpiration, and the two that iterate -- and finds all 329 values
# bit-identical.
#
# So: expect ZERO. Any finite difference now is real and should be investigated;
# the nested solvers amplify perturbations up to about GSS_tol_abs (1e-3), so a
# genuine arithmetic difference shows up around 1e-4.
#
# Run this against `main`, whose set_physiology signature still matches plant's.
# The `feature/api-cleanup` branch deliberately diverges (different signature), so
# this script does not apply there; its deviations are measured in its own commits.
#
# REFERENCE BUILD. Compare against plant built from the commit this package was
# extracted from, NOT whatever happens to be installed -- the installed plant may
# be a different branch. Recreate it with:
#
#   git -C ../plant worktree add /tmp/plant-ref 76df7169
#   R CMD INSTALL --no-docs -l /tmp/rlib-ref /tmp/plant-ref
#   R_LIBS=/tmp/rlib-ref Rscript tests/validate/compare_with_plant.R
#
# (The first attempt at this compared against an installed plant carrying the ATLS
# thermal-damage layer, which is a different branch. It gave identical numbers,
# because ATLS is default-off and genuinely bit-identical when off -- but that was
# luck, not method.)
