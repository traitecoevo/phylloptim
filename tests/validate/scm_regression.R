# PLAN.md item 1: the SCM regression, which is the check that mattered there --
# an adaptive stepper and a discrete node-splitting schedule could turn a
# below-tolerance perturbation into a visible difference. It did not: 78/78 nodes.
#
#   R_LIBS=<lib> Rscript tests/validate/scm_regression.R <output.rds>
#
# Runs a TF24 size-structured (SCM) simulation and writes the numeric results to
# an .rds. Run it twice -- once against a plant built with its own leaf, once
# against a plant built on `feature/consume-leaf-package` -- then compare with
# scm_compare.R.
#
# WHY this is worth doing separately from the operating-point grid. The grid showed
# agreement to 1 ULP on a single leaf solve. The SCM integrates that solve millions
# of times through an adaptive ODE solver with a node-splitting schedule, and both
# of those have thresholds: a perturbation far below tolerance can still change
# which side of a refinement decision a step lands on, and that changes the node
# schedule, which is discrete. So the question the grid cannot answer is whether
# 1 ULP stays 1 ULP, or whether it is amplified by the discrete machinery on top.
#
# The scenario is lifted from plant's own tests/testthat/test-strategy-tf24.R so it
# is a configuration known to run and known to be checked. max_patch_lifetime is 5
# there, which keeps this to seconds; raise it for a more demanding check.
