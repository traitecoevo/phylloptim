# Helpers for the R-side golden check. See test-golden.R for why it exists.

# This used to restate the C++ default constructor's trait values, because stage
# 1 bound only the 19-argument constructor and the R side had to name them all.
# It no longer does, and that is the improvement: `leaf_model()` carries the
# package's own defaults now, so solving through it here is what CHECKS those
# defaults still equal `leaf::Leaf`'s. If the two ever drift apart the bit-exact
# comparisons in test-golden.R fail, rather than quietly measuring a different
# model than the one the golden file was generated from.
default_leaf <- function() leaf_model()

# --- how exactly to compare -------------------------------------------------
#
# The golden file is bit-exact ONLY on the platform that generated it,
# macOS/arm64, and this is not a shortcut being taken -- libm's exp/pow are not
# bit-reproducible between glibc on x86-64 and Apple's libm on arm64, and FMA
# contraction differs too, so cross-platform bit-equality was never achievable.
# tests/cpp/test_golden.cpp has had a `--cross-platform` mode for this since it
# was written; the R side needs the same policy, and got it the hard way -- the
# first version of this file asserted bit-exactness everywhere, passed on macOS,
# and failed on Linux CI at the 16th significant figure.
#
# Tolerances are the C++ suite's, measured over the full grid rather than
# guessed, and they are per-CLASS because the fields split into two groups three
# orders of magnitude apart:
#
#   profit          the maximum itself, and so well conditioned
#   everything else evaluated at the ARGMAX of a flat maximum, so an error dp in
#                   the profit value displaces its location by sqrt(dp/k)
#
# If you need a magnitude, read those numbers, not a failure list.
