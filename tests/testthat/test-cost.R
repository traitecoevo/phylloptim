# Guards against the R boundary quietly getting more expensive.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Nothing else in this package looks at the clock, on the
# stated grounds that absolute microseconds are machine-dependent. That is true, and
# it is also exactly how a 4.5x regression reached a green CI: `set_drivers()` began
# constructing a `RootNetwork` per call, which took `leaf_solve()` from 23.7 to
# 108 us/row, and the whole suite, the golden tie-back and six CI jobs passed.
#
# So the guards here are of two kinds, in order of trustworthiness:
#
#   1. COUNTING, which is deterministic. The regression was a `.Call` appearing in a
#      per-row path, and a count of `.Call`s has no variance at all. This is the real
#      guard; prefer adding to it.
#   2. A RATIO, for what counting cannot foresee. Never an absolute time: a bare
#      `.Call` on one machine moved 0.69 -> 1.10 us between two runs an hour apart on
#      the same build. Cost divided by the cost of a trivial `.Call` in the SAME
#      process is stable across machines, so that is what is bounded -- generously,
#      so it catches a doubling rather than policing a few percent.
#
# `tools/bench_user_cost.R` is the measurement these thresholds came from, and
# `tools/bench_history.sh` runs it against past commits.

# Count how many times a generated `.Call` wrapper is invoked while evaluating
# `expr`, by swapping the namespace binding for a counting one. Deterministic, and
# it observes the thing that actually went wrong rather than a symptom of it.
