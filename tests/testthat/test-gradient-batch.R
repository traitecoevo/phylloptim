# The batched trait gradient (issue #4, PLAN 11d stage 2).
#
# WHAT IS BEING PINNED HERE, in order of how much it matters.
#
#   1. That the C++ composite computes the SAME THING as `leaf_gradient()`,
#      bit-for-bit, over both supply paths, both methods and the pinned and
#      shut-down rows. This is the whole risk of stage 2: it is a second
#      implementation of an algorithm that already exists, and the two share no
#      code, so a transcription slip has nothing to hide behind. Bit-for-bit
#      rather than close, because a tolerance would let one hide inside the
#      solver's own ~1e-09 floor -- and because the composite's arithmetic order,
#      its avoidance of fused multiply-add and its explicit call sequencing were
#      all written for this test and would otherwise not be checked at all.
#
#   2. That the values are what they were. ⚠️ (1) CANNOT SEE A CHANGE APPLIED
#      CONSISTENTLY TO BOTH. Move the step rule, the stationarity threshold or a
#      solver tolerance and the two implementations move together, the equality
#      test passes, and nothing says the gradients changed. That is the trap #70
#      hit inside R alone. So `gradient_golden.tsv` records them, and its five
#      rows agree with the independently arbitrated references in
#      test-gradient.R -- which is the check that the transcription is RIGHT and
#      not merely self-consistent. ⚠️ It is bit-exact only on macOS/arm64, and
#      compared with the golden file's own per-class tolerance elsewhere, for the
#      reason helper-golden.R gives at length.
#
#   3. That a row the solve cannot handle costs THAT ROW. A proposal during a fit
#      will reach such points; taking out the dataset for one of them would take
#      out the draw.
#
#   4. That the parameter enumeration cannot drift. R passes integer POSITIONS
#      into it, so a reordering silently differentiates the wrong parameter.

# `grid_drivers()` and `batch_drivers()` are in helper-gradient.R, shared with
# test-gradient.R so both files pin the same operating points.

# One row's gradient through the batch, in `leaf_gradient()`'s shape, so the two
# can be compared field by field without every test restating the indexing.
