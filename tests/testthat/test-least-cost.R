# The R surface of the least-cost curve (Prentice et al. 2014).
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT TESTED HERE. The physics is checked in C++, in
# `tests/cpp/test_leaf.cpp`, where the solved chi is compared against Prentice et
# al.'s first-order condition to 1e-11 and the published closed form's own error
# is predicted. This file covers what that cannot reach: that the curve is
# REACHABLE from R, that `LeastCost_beta` survives the trip through
# `leaf_solve()`, and that the refusals arrive as R conditions rather than as a
# crash. One closed-form check is repeated here anyway, because a curve that is
# wired to the wrong field would still solve and would still return a number.
