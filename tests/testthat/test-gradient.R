# Trait gradients: set_traits() and leaf_gradient() (issue #4, PLAN 11d stage 1).
#
# Two things are being pinned here, and they are not equally hard.
#
#   1. That the implicit-function composite is right where its premise holds.
#      This is the easy half: the reference values below were arbitrated against
#      a least-squares slope of the solved output over a +-2% trait span at
#      n = 41, and the composite agrees to about four digits.
#   2. That it is NOT used where its premise fails. This is the half that took
#      the work. At a wet-pinned optimum the bare composite returns O(1) where
#      the truth is ~1e-08 -- plausible-looking and wrong by seven orders of
#      magnitude -- so the test that matters is the one asserting the guard
#      fires. `method = "ift"` exists so that failure can be provoked on demand
#      rather than described in a comment.

# `grid_drivers()` and `grid_gradient()` moved to helper-gradient.R when
# test-gradient-batch.R needed the same operating points: each test file gets its
# own environment, so a second copy would have been free to drift and the two
# files would have pinned different points while appearing to pin the same ones.
