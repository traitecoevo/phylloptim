# The R layer's regression baseline: four points from the C++ golden grid,
# reproduced through the R API and compared BIT-EXACTLY.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. tests/cpp/ is the regression baseline for the model, and
# it is completely blind to the R layer -- it never loads it. A mistranslation in
# inst/RcppR6_classes.yml (two arguments transposed, a field bound to the wrong
# member, a vector silently truncated) produces a green C++ suite and plausible
# numbers in R. Nothing else in this package would notice. So the R side needs
# its own tie-back to the recorded values, and comparing to anything less than
# the full 17 digits would let exactly the errors this is for slip through.
#
# WHY THE EXPECTED VALUES ARE HEX FLOATS, and why you must not "tidy" them into
# decimals. R's decimal string-to-double conversion is not correctly rounded:
# as.numeric, scan and read.delim all share it, and on a random sample about 18%
# of full-precision inputs come back one ULP away from the correctly rounded
# value. Pasting the golden file's %.17g strings in here would therefore make
# roughly a fifth of these comparisons fail against a model that is exactly
# right. That is not a hypothetical -- it is issue #13, where a supposed 1-ULP
# disagreement between this package and plant turned out to be entirely the
# measuring instrument: all 2352 finite values were bit-identical, and 345 of
# the 585 apparent mismatches were the parser. R reads C99 hex exactly (4000 of
# 4000 round-trip, against 3265 of 4000 for %.17g), so hex is what goes here.
#
# To regenerate after a DELIBERATE change to the golden file:
#
#   cc -O2 -o /tmp/tsv_to_hex tests/validate/tsv_to_hex.c
#   awk -F'\t' 'NR==1 || ($4==25 && $1==2 && $2==900 && $3==2 && $5==3)' \
#     tests/cpp/golden/operating_points.tsv | /tmp/tsv_to_hex
#
# and paste the row. The C tool parses with the C library's strtod, which is
# correctly rounded, and prints %a.
#
# ⚠️ The `$4==25` is not decoration. The golden file's columns are psi_soil, ppfd,
# vpd, LEAF_TEMP, layers -- two temperatures, so a tab-anchored `grep` on position
# matches leaf_temp where it means layers and pulls the wrong row. Select on the
# named column, not on position in a remembered layout.
#
# Last regenerated for the (P50, c) reparameterisation, which moved 30 of these 36
# values by ~1e-08 relative. The six that did not are the shut-down row's four
# exact zeros plus its ci and assim: that row never reaches the collar solve, so
# nothing it reports depends on the vulnerability curve -- except psi_stem, which
# IS psi_crit and moves with it. That split is why the row is here.
#
# Before that, #92 (the indexed knot grid) moved 27, the psi_stem_to_ci tolerance
# 18, and the collar root-find 27.

# Four points, chosen to exercise different parts of the model rather than to
# sample the grid evenly:
#
#   1 layer          the single-layer path, which is also the one the
#                    optimise_psi_stem_* solvers require
#   3 and 5 layers   the multi-layer supply path, where the R side has to get a
#                    whole vector across in the right order -- a transposed or
#                    reversed soil profile is invisible at one layer
#   the last row     a SHUT-DOWN point (psi_soil 6 MPa, low light, high VPD):
#                    transpiration and gc are exactly zero, assimilation is
#                    negative and the collar sits at psi_stem. This is the
#                    branch #15 fixed, and it is the one where an output a code
#                    path declines to write becomes the previous leaf's value.
#                    Pinning it here means the R layer is checked on the exit
#                    that has actually gone wrong before, not just the happy one.
