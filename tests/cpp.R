# Run the C++ suite under `R CMD check` (issue #12, PLAN item 15).
#
# This package ships headers and nothing else -- no R code, no compiled code --
# so without this file `R CMD check` validates essentially nothing. The point is
# not to duplicate the GitHub Actions workflow: it is that a `LinkingTo: phylloptim`
# consumer's own `R CMD check`, on their machine and their toolchain, tells them
# when a header stops compiling. That is the failure mode that matters for a
# header-only package, and it is invisible to every other check R runs here.
#
# Two deliberate choices:
#
#   * Compile with R's *configured* compiler (`R CMD config CXX20`) rather than
#     whatever `c++` is on PATH, because that is the compiler a consumer builds
#     with.
#   * Compile against the *installed* headers rather than ../../inst/include.
#     Under `R CMD check` those are different directories, and the installed one
#     is what a consumer gets -- so this also catches an install that failed to
#     ship a header the others include.
#
# WHY NOT JUST CALL `make -C tests/cpp`, which is what a developer runs? Because
# `tests/cpp/Makefile` uses GNU extensions (`?=`, `$(shell)`, `$(wildcard)`,
# `ifeq`), and `R CMD check` scans every Makefile in the tarball and warns about
# them. The sanctioned way to silence that is `SystemRequirements: GNU make` --
# but that would be a false statement about this package. Installing it requires
# no make whatsoever; only its own test harness does, and a `LinkingTo: phylloptim`
# consumer would inherit a declared dependency they do not have. So the Makefile
# stays for developers and is left out of the tarball (see .Rbuildignore), and
# the two translation units are compiled directly here. It is two compiler calls.
