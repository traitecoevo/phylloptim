// Trait gradients, composed here rather than in R (issue #4, PLAN 11d stage 2).
//
// WHAT THIS IS. A transcription of R/gradient.R's `.gradient_ift()` and
// `.gradient_fd()` into C++, plus a loop over observations. It computes exactly
// what `leaf_gradient()` computes and returns the same six things; the whole
// point of it is that a four-parameter gradient crosses the R boundary ONCE
// instead of 112 times.
//
// WHY, measured. After #69 and #70 a four-parameter gradient from R costs
// ~237 us per observation, of which the C++ model work -- two solves -- is
// 6 us, or 1.5%. The other 98.5% is dispatch and the R interpreter.
// `tests/cpp/bench_gradient.cpp` times the same composite here at 1.8 us per
// trait. For a 1,327-observation MCMC that is the difference between hours and
// minutes, and it is why the entry point is vectorised over OBSERVATIONS: one
// crossing per likelihood evaluation, not one per parameter per observation.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT: a likelihood. The likelihood is the caller's
// model -- sigma, robustness, hierarchy -- and baking one in would commit this
// package to it. This returns dY/dtheta for the FOUR model parameters a leaf
// has; the caller's parameterisation Jacobian (leaf-calibration maps 40 fitted
// parameters onto 4 model ones) stays in R, vectorised over observations, where
// it is cheap. That split is the `P_fit > P_model` structure
// `vignette("fitting")` identified as where the exact gradient wins at all.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THIS IS A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ALGORITHM THAT ALREADY EXISTS, and
// that is the risk that dominates everything else here. R/gradient.R stays as
// the reference and the two must agree BIT-FOR-BIT, not closely -- a tolerance
// would let a transcription slip hide inside the solver's ~1e-09 floor. Three
// rules follow, and all three are load-bearing:
//
//   1. R's ARITHMETIC ORDER IS KEPT LITERALLY, including where a division could
//      be folded into a neighbouring one. `-((up - dn) / (2 * h)) / H` is not
//      rewritten as `(dn - up) / (2 * h * H)`.
//   2. NO FUSED MULTIPLY-ADD. See `rounded()` below; `a + b * c` written as one
//      expression compiles to `fmadd` on arm64 and differs from R's two
//      roundings on 28% of random triples, which is a 1e-16 disagreement in a
//      test that asserts equality.
//   3. THE CALL ORDER IS SEQUENCED EXPLICITLY. `f(a) - f(b)` has unspecified
//      operand order in C++ and left-to-right order in R, and these `f`s mutate
//      the leaf. Every difference below names its two halves first.
//
// `tests/testthat/test-gradient-batch.R` is what holds that, over both supply
// paths, both methods and the pinned and shut-down rows.
