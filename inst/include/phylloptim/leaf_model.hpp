  //     G(psi; s*b, c) = s * G(psi/s; b, c)

  // because G(psi; b, c) = b * g(psi/b; c) for g(u; c) = integral of

  // with it too (psi_max = b*log(100)^(1/c)), so the identity holds for the
  // SPLINE and not merely for the integral it approximates: measured, the
  // rescaled spline reproduces a rebuilt one to 0-3e-16.
  //

  // of a gradient in stem_b (PLAN 11f).

  // supply agree, and there is no intermediate state in which they do not.
  //

// ONE REPRESENTATION FOR WATER POTENTIAL  [#25, superseding #7's two-convention map]
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// EVERY psi in this package is a POSITIVE MAGNITUDE in MPa. There is no second
// representation, no flip, and no bridge point. `psi_soil_`, `psi_crit`,
// `root_psi_crit`, `stem_b`, `root_b`, `opt_psi_stem_`, `opt_root_psi_`, the
// find_root_psi / E_column root variable, find_psi_stem_from_psi_root's
// psi_root, transpiration's psi_upstream, and all four spline domains are the
// same kind of number. `set_physiology` asserts psi_soil >= 0 and the
// constructor asserts psi_crit > 0 and stem_b > 0, so the convention is
// checkable rather than merely documented -- which is the point: before #25
// there was no global statement to assert, because the answer depended on which
// variable you asked about.
//
// Where an equation needs one potential to oppose another, THE MINUS SIGN IS IN
// THE EQUATION, not in the storage. The soil -> collar flux is
//
//     E_i = (T_collar - T_soil_i - gravity_head * z_i) / r_R
//
// which reads directly: to draw water you must pull harder than the soil holds
// it, plus enough to lift it. E_i < 0 still means the layer is gaining water.
//
// What this buys, beyond tidiness: dE_up/dT_collar is now +1/r, a conductance,
// positive by construction. Under the signed convention the same derivative came
// back negative where a conductance was wanted, and that produced a negative
// lambda in marginal_cost_water_multilayer -- a bug that had to be patched with a
// negation. That whole class of error cannot occur here.
//
// ⚠️ DO NOT call this convention "tension" in the code. It is exact only because
// there is no osmotic term anywhere and the gravitational component is carried
// separately as `gravity_head`, so psi here is a pure pressure potential. Add
// solutes and "tension" becomes wrong while "magnitude of psi" stays right.
//
// TWO THINGS #7 GOT RIGHT AND #25 KEEPS:
//
//   * transpiration() and its inverse transpiration_to_psi_stem() used to read
//     eval(psi_upstream) and eval(-psi_upstream) respectively. #7 recorded that
//     as "NOT a bug -- they are called with psi_upstream of OPPOSITE sign". True,
//     and it stopped being necessary: they now take the same convention, and the
//     inverse's negation is gone.
//   * opt_root_psi_ (exported as the opt_root_psi aux) and opt_psi_stem_ agree in
//     ALL branches of find_root_collar_psi. #7 established that for opt_psi_stem_
//     and for the collar's sign-consistency across exits; #25 makes them the same
//     kind of number as each other, and as plant's state variable of the same
//     name, whose two compensating negations are deleted.
//
// The member is called `opt_root_psi_`, not `root_collar_psi_`. Renamed
// deliberately: keeping the old name with a flipped sign is the one genuinely
// dangerous outcome here, because an old analysis would silently read the wrong
// sign. A rename gives a binding error instead.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the entry point called once per individual per environment update
// (from TF24_Strategy::net_mass_production_dt). It solves the whole
// soil -> root -> stem -> leaf hydraulic continuum and stores the optimal
// operating point in opt_psi_stem_, opt_root_psi_ and profit_.
//
// The solve has two nested levels:
//
//   1. CONTINUITY (find_root_psi / E_column): for any candidate root-collar
//      potential, water supplied from the soil (E_from_Soil_to_Root_Collar)
//      must equal water transpired through the stem (transpiration()). This is
//      a 1-D root-find on the collar potential.
//
//   2. OPTIMISATION (Golden-Section Search): among feasible collar potentials,
//      choose the one that maximises carbon profit = assimilation - hydraulic
//      cost (profit_psi_stem_TF). The collar potential is bracketed between
//      `root_zero_E` (collar where soil uptake is zero, the wettest feasible
//      point) and `root_crit` (collar at which the stem reaches psi_crit, the
//      driest feasible point), clamped to root_psi_crit.
//
// Several early-exit short-circuits avoid the (expensive) GSS loop when no
// meaningful optimisation is possible. In each case the plant is effectively
// shut down (operating at psi_crit, paying only respiration + hydraulic cost):
//   * wettest soil layer is already drier than psi_crit -> no transpiration;
//   * even at psi_crit the soil cannot supply the demanded flux (E_column<0);
//   * the continuity root would require the collar drier than psi_crit;
//   * maximum possible assimilation (at ci = ca) is negative.
//
// Implementation note: psi_soil is a positive magnitude here as everywhere else
// (#25), so nothing is flipped. The GSS reuses one
// profit evaluation per iteration (golden ratio) to halve function calls, and
// a collapsed-interval branch handles the degenerate single-feasible-point case.
// Shut-down operating point shared by find_root_collar_psi's early-exits: the

// WHY this replaced golden section, in one line each -- PLAN 11a has the numbers:
//
//  * Golden section resolves the argmax only to GSS_tol_abs (1e-3), leaving the
//    returned collar ~1e-4 MPa from the true stationary point with an offset that
//    wanders as the comparison sequence flips. That offset IS the staircase that
//    made trait derivatives unusable.
//  * The damage was not merely a staircase. For traits in the hydraulic path the
//    wandering offset DOMINATED the real trait response, so the argmax came back
//    smooth, plausible and SIGN-INVERTED (root_b: -2.6e-03 where the truth is
//    +2.6e-04). Arbitrated against a 20001-point derivative-free scan of profit.
//  * It cannot be fixed downstream. No finite-difference step size and no amount
//    of differentiating through the iterations recovers it, because the error is
//    in the solved argmax rather than in how the argmax is differentiated.
//  * Hazard 3 -- "the argmax must vary smoothly with inputs" -- is IMPROVED, not
//    threatened: measured ~800x better second differences in the traits. The
//    hazard's own concern is smoothness in plant state, which cannot be measured
//    here while plant #591 blocks end-to-end validation; same mechanism, so the
//    same direction is expected, but it is not the same measurement.
//
// Safeguarded, not Newton: TOMS748 keeps a bracket throughout, so a non-monotone
// or kinked case degrades instead of diverging. Monotonicity was measured on all
// 240 feasible golden-grid rows, but that is a grid, not a theorem. This also
// makes the collar the third leaf solver on this method -- see uniroot.hpp's

  // to gain ~1e-07 of profit on a flat maximum, which is not a trade worth making.

// lucky. Check with `nm -C test_golden | grep dprofit` before and after.
//
// THE DERIVATION. When the gate is on, psi reaches profit by two further routes
// beyond the two already accounted for:
//
//   psi -> psi_stem -> E -> Tleaf -> theta(Tleaf) -> A          (direct)
//   psi -> psi_stem -> E -> Tleaf -> the ci residual -> ci -> A (indirect)
//
// The second is the subtle one. psi_stem_to_ci root-finds
// g(ci; psi_stem, psi, T) = A(ci,T)*umol_to_mol - gc*(ca-ci)*inv_atm = 0, and the
// demand side reads the temperature-dependent members, so g gains an EXPLICIT T
// argument. Differentiating g = 0 totally in psi adds g_T * dT/dpsi to the
// existing terms, with g_T = A_T * umol_to_mol, so
//
//   dci/dpsi  +=  -(A_T * umol_to_mol * tau) / g_ci .
//
// Adding that to the direct term A_T * tau and collecting:
//
//   Delta = A_T * tau * (1 - A_prime*umol_to_mol/g_ci)
//         = A_T * tau * (gc*inv_atm) / g_ci        since g_ci = A_prime*umol_to_mol + gc*inv_atm
//
// Two consequences worth keeping, because each is a free check on the algebra:
//
//  * the damping factor (gc*inv_atm)/g_ci lies strictly in (0,1). The direct
//    thermal effect on A is partly cancelled because ci re-equilibrates. If an
//    implementation ever produces |Delta| > |A_T*tau|, it is wrong.
//  * dE/dpsi > 0 and dT/dE < 0, so tau < 0. Above the thermal optimum A_T < 0
//    and therefore Delta > 0: the corrected condition pushes the optimum DRIER,
//    i.e. toward more transpiration, because the extra flux now buys evaporative
//    cooling back toward the optimum. That is the decoupling mechanism, and its
//    sign is the sharpest available test that this term is right.
//
