  // with it too (psi_max = b*log(100)^(1/c)), so the identity holds for the
  // SPLINE and not merely for the integral it approximates: measured, the
  // rescaled spline reproduces a rebuilt one to 0-3e-16.
  //
  // So moving stem_b needs no rebuild at all -- just the existing spline
  // evaluated at a rescaled argument. That matters because a rebuild is 11.9 us
  // of incomplete gammas plus 3.1 us per interpolator, which is the entire cost
  // of a gradient in stem_b (PLAN 11f).
  //
  // ⚠️ There is NO SUCH IDENTITY FOR stem_c, and the obvious substitute -- read

  // Two rules keep this from becoming a stale-state bug of the kind hazard 8

  // supply agree, and there is no intermediate state in which they do not.
  //

// ONE REPRESENTATION FOR WATER POTENTIAL  [#25, superseding #7's two-convention map]
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// EVERY psi in this package is a POSITIVE MAGNITUDE in MPa. There is no second
// representation, no flip, and no bridge point. `psi_soil_`, `psi_crit`,
// `root_psi_crit`, `stem_b`, `root_b`, `opt_psi_stem_`, `opt_root_psi_`, the
// find_root_psi / E_column root variable, find_psi_stem_from_psi_root's
// psi_root, transpiration's psi_upstream, and all four spline domains are the
// same kind of number. `set_physiology` asserts psi_soil >= 0 and the
// constructor asserts psi_crit > 0 and stem_b > 0, so the convention is
// checkable rather than merely documented -- which is the point: before #25
// there was no global statement to assert, because the answer depended on which
// variable you asked about.
//
// Where an equation needs one potential to oppose another, THE MINUS SIGN IS IN
// THE EQUATION, not in the storage. The soil -> collar flux is
//
//     E_i = (T_collar - T_soil_i - gravity_head * z_i) / r_R
//
// which reads directly: to draw water you must pull harder than the soil holds
// it, plus enough to lift it. E_i < 0 still means the layer is gaining water.
//
// What this buys, beyond tidiness: dE_up/dT_collar is now +1/r, a conductance,
// positive by construction. Under the signed convention the same derivative came
// back negative where a conductance was wanted, and that produced a negative
// lambda in marginal_cost_water_multilayer -- a bug that had to be patched with a
// negation. That whole class of error cannot occur here.
//
// ⚠️ DO NOT call this convention "tension" in the code. It is exact only because
// there is no osmotic term anywhere and the gravitational component is carried
// separately as `gravity_head`, so psi here is a pure pressure potential. Add
// solutes and "tension" becomes wrong while "magnitude of psi" stays right.
//
// TWO THINGS #7 GOT RIGHT AND #25 KEEPS:
//
//   * transpiration() and its inverse transpiration_to_psi_stem() used to read
//     eval(psi_upstream) and eval(-psi_upstream) respectively. #7 recorded that
//     as "NOT a bug -- they are called with psi_upstream of OPPOSITE sign". True,
//     and it stopped being necessary: they now take the same convention, and the
//     inverse's negation is gone.
//   * opt_root_psi_ (exported as the opt_root_psi aux) and opt_psi_stem_ agree in
//     ALL branches of find_root_collar_psi. #7 established that for opt_psi_stem_
//     and for the collar's sign-consistency across exits; #25 makes them the same
//     kind of number as each other, and as plant's state variable of the same
//     name, whose two compensating negations are deleted.
//
// The member is called `opt_root_psi_`, not `root_collar_psi_`. Renamed
// deliberately: keeping the old name with a flipped sign is the one genuinely
// dangerous outcome here, because an old analysis would silently read the wrong
// sign. A rename gives a binding error instead.

// (from TF24_Strategy::net_mass_production_dt). It solves the whole
// soil -> root -> stem -> leaf hydraulic continuum and stores the optimal
// operating point in opt_psi_stem_, opt_root_psi_ and profit_.
//
// The solve has two nested levels:
//
//   1. CONTINUITY (find_root_psi / E_column): for any candidate root-collar
//      potential, water supplied from the soil (E_from_Soil_to_Root_Collar)
//      must equal water transpired through the stem (transpiration()). This is
//      a 1-D root-find on the collar potential.
//
//   2. OPTIMISATION (Golden-Section Search): among feasible collar potentials,
//      choose the one that maximises carbon profit = assimilation - hydraulic
//      cost (profit_psi_stem_TF). The collar potential is bracketed between
//      `root_zero_E` (collar where soil uptake is zero, the wettest feasible
//      point) and `root_crit` (collar at which the stem reaches psi_crit, the
//      driest feasible point), clamped to root_psi_crit.
//
// Several early-exit short-circuits avoid the (expensive) GSS loop when no
// meaningful optimisation is possible. In each case the plant is effectively
// shut down (operating at psi_crit, paying only respiration + hydraulic cost):
//   * wettest soil layer is already drier than psi_crit -> no transpiration;
//   * even at psi_crit the soil cannot supply the demanded flux (E_column<0);
//   * the continuity root would require the collar drier than psi_crit;
//   * maximum possible assimilation (at ci = ca) is negative.
//
// Implementation note: psi_soil is a positive magnitude here as everywhere else
// (#25), so nothing is flipped. The GSS reuses one
// profit evaluation per iteration (golden ratio) to halve function calls, and
// a collapsed-interval branch handles the degenerate single-feasible-point case.
// Shut-down operating point shared by find_root_collar_psi's early-exits: the

//
// WHY this replaced golden section, in one line each -- PLAN 11a has the numbers:
//
//  * Golden section resolves the argmax only to GSS_tol_abs (1e-3), leaving the
//    returned collar ~1e-4 MPa from the true stationary point with an offset that
//    wanders as the comparison sequence flips. That offset IS the staircase that
//    made trait derivatives unusable.
//  * The damage was not merely a staircase. For traits in the hydraulic path the
//    wandering offset DOMINATED the real trait response, so the argmax came back
//    smooth, plausible and SIGN-INVERTED (root_b: -2.6e-03 where the truth is
//    +2.6e-04). Arbitrated against a 20001-point derivative-free scan of profit.
//  * It cannot be fixed downstream. No finite-difference step size and no amount
//    of differentiating through the iterations recovers it, because the error is
//    in the solved argmax rather than in how the argmax is differentiated.
//  * Hazard 3 -- "the argmax must vary smoothly with inputs" -- is IMPROVED, not
//    threatened: measured ~800x better second differences in the traits. The
//    hazard's own concern is smoothness in plant state, which cannot be measured
//    here while plant #591 blocks end-to-end validation; same mechanism, so the
//    same direction is expected, but it is not the same measurement.
//
// Safeguarded, not Newton: TOMS748 keeps a bracket throughout, so a non-monotone
// or kinked case degrades instead of diverging. Monotonicity was measured on all
// 240 feasible golden-grid rows, but that is a grid, not a theorem. This also
// makes the collar the third leaf solver on this method -- see uniroot.hpp's

  // ⚠️ **Return lo/hi, NOT bound_a/bound_b.** Returning the raw bound was tried

  // profit is -4.696 just inside the boundary and -6.136 at bound_a itself, a jump
  // of exactly the 1.44 that showed up on 22 golden rows as a profit DECREASE. The
  // #31 region is the reason the wet endpoint has to be stepped over rather than
  // evaluated, and the same reason it must not be returned.
  //
  // What lo buys, stated honestly: on a wet-pinned row the true argmax sits
  // essentially ON the feasibility boundary -- a fine scan puts it at 6.4e-07 and
  // 3.2e-09 of the bracket width from bound_a on the two worst rows -- so lo
  // resolves it to the step-in scale (~1e-6 of the width), not to
  // collar_root_tol. That is still ~100x tighter than the GSS_tol_abs it replaces,
  // and it beat golden section on profit at both of those rows. Bisecting for the
  // exact feasibility boundary would cost ~40 gradient evaluations on the hot path
  // to gain ~1e-07 of profit on a flat maximum, which is not a trade worth making.
  //
  // Worth knowing downstream: where a row crosses between interior and pinned the
  // argmax has a genuine KINK. That belongs to the constrained problem rather than
  // to this solver -- golden section has it too -- but it is a real
  // non-differentiable set in trait space, and it sits where a calibration is most
  // likely to wander.
  //
  // ⚠️ The two pin tests are not exhaustive, and the leftover case is a FAILURE

// symbol at all (hazard 5), and adding a branch inside such a body can change
// which expressions land in one inlined block and therefore change FMA
// contraction. That would move the GATE-OFF path, i.e. the golden file, for no
// reason anyone could read from the diff. Keeping the block behind its own
// symbol is what makes "bit-identical with the gate off" structural rather than
// lucky. Check with `nm -C test_golden | grep dprofit` before and after.
//
// THE DERIVATION. When the gate is on, psi reaches profit by two further routes
// beyond the two already accounted for:
//
//  * DIRECT:   psi -> psi_stem -> E -> Tleaf -> theta(Tleaf) -> A
//  * INDIRECT: psi -> psi_stem -> E -> Tleaf -> the ci residual -> ci -> A
//
// The second is the subtle one. psi_stem_to_ci root-finds
// g(ci; psi_stem, psi, T) = A(ci,T)*umol_to_mol - gc*(ca-ci)*inv_atm = 0, and the
// demand side reads the temperature-dependent members, so g gains an EXPLICIT T
// argument. Differentiating g = 0 totally in psi adds g_T * dT/dpsi to the
// existing terms, with g_T = A_T * umol_to_mol, so `dci/dpsi` gains
// `-(A_T * umol_to_mol * tau) / g_ci`.
//
// Adding that to the direct term `A_T * tau` and collecting gives
// `Delta = A_T * tau * (1 - A_prime*umol_to_mol/g_ci)`, which since
// `g_ci = A_prime*umol_to_mol + gc*inv_atm` is the same as
// `Delta = A_T * tau * (gc*inv_atm) / g_ci`.
//
// Two consequences worth keeping, because each is a free check on the algebra:
//
//  * the damping factor (gc*inv_atm)/g_ci lies strictly in (0,1). The direct
//    thermal effect on A is partly cancelled because ci re-equilibrates. If an
//    implementation ever produces |Delta| > |A_T*tau|, it is wrong.
//  * dE/dpsi > 0 and dT/dE < 0, so tau < 0. Above the thermal optimum A_T < 0
//    and therefore Delta > 0: the corrected condition pushes the optimum DRIER,
//    i.e. toward more transpiration, because the extra flux now buys evaporative
//    cooling back toward the optimum. That is the decoupling mechanism, and its
//    sign is the sharpest available test that this term is right.
//
// ⚠️ `dgc_dT` IS NOW NON-ZERO, and the placeholder algebra that stood here while
// it was zero did NOT generalise. This block used to carry a named
// `const double dgc_dT = 0.0` with a note promising that PLAN 13.1 would make it
// "a one-line change instead of a re-derivation". The note was wrong: the
// damping factor it multiplied, `(gc*inv_atm - dgc_dT*(ca-ci)*inv_atm)/g_ci`,
// puts the new term under `A_T` where the derivation puts it under `A_prime`.
// The two agree only at dgc_dT = 0, which is why nothing caught it. Derived
// again, in full, below.
//
// g(ci; psi_stem, psi, T) = A(ci,T)*umol_to_mol - gc(T)*(ca-ci)*inv_atm = 0, so
//
//   g_T    = A_T*umol_to_mol - dgc_dT*(ca-ci)*inv_atm
//   dci/dT = -g_T/g_ci
//   dA/dT (total) = A_T + A_prime*dci/dT
//                 = [A_T*gc*inv_atm + A_prime*dgc_dT*(ca-ci)*inv_atm] / g_ci
//
// using g_ci = A_prime*umol_to_mol + gc*inv_atm to collect. At dgc_dT = 0 this is
// `A_T * (gc*inv_atm)/g_ci`, i.e. exactly what the old expression returned, so

// Sperry et al. (2017) ProfitMax, as Sicangco et al. (2026) implement it
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Sperry maximises `Profit = CG - HC` with both terms normalised. Multiplying
// that objective by |A|max turns it into `A - lambda*(k(psi_soil)-k(psi))`, the
// same function up to a positive scale factor and so the same argmax, with lambda
// taking the value below. That is a property worth knowing rather than a second
// entry point: the lambda is not a constant, so prescribing one is not this
// model.
//
//     CG      = A(psi)/|A|max
//     HC      = [k(psi_soil)-k(psi)] / [k(psi_soil)-kcrit]
//     lambda* = |A|max / [k(psi_soil) - kcrit]
//
// Checked numerically on a 4001-point grid at gross assimilation, at net, and at
// a leaf temperature of 48 C where CG is negative throughout: same grid point
// every time. So the lambda form is not wrong -- it is unusable, because lambda*
// is not a constant. |A|max moves with every driver and k(psi_soil) with the
// soil, so a caller has to rescan the supply stream and recompute lambda at every
// observation, from R, at ~1.8 us of call overhead per crossing against a ~3 us
// model. This does it in C++ and reports the profit in Sperry's own units, so a
// figure from this package can be laid over one from the paper.
//
// THE NORMALISATION IS NOT COSMETIC, which is the other reason to have it. HC
// runs 0 to 1 across the operating range HOWEVER WIDE the vulnerability curve is,
// because the denominator rescales with the curve -- so a ProfitMax cost cannot
// become numerically negligible the way the TF24 cost does as stem_b widens
// (measured at 1.3e-5 at stem_b = 200). Both terms are scale-free, which also
// means the plant's willingness to spend water does not depend on how much carbon
// is at stake in absolute terms. That is exactly what TF24_cost_scale decides on
// the TF24 path, and it is the parameter a calibration cannot identify without
// leaf water potential.
//
// ⚠️ kcrit IS 5% OF kmax, and that is the same convention this package already
// has rather than a new one. Sperry, Sabot et al. (2020) and Sicangco all set

  // both of those, in exactly the regime the model is interesting in. Measured at
  // Tair 50 C with the thermal cost on: the profit runs -1.5314 at psi_soil,
  // -1.5510 at 1.19, -1.5459 at 1.88, then falls away, so the GLOBAL maximum is
  // the closed-stomata endpoint and there is a local one near 1.9. Brent returned
  // 1.643. The model was reporting a leaf with open stomata where the objective

// ⚠️ THIS CURVE HAS A BENEFIT LINK, AND IT IS CURRENTLY IMPLICIT. Taking logs turns
// the product into the same additive skeleton as every other curve here:
//
//     log(A*g) = log A + log g,    so   C(psi) = -log g(psi),  dC/dpsi = -g'/g
//
// which is a row of the cost table rather than an exception to it, and is the form
// `lambda_SOX` below already uses -- it is `(dC/dpsi)/(dE/dpsi)` for that `C`, times
// `A` to return from log-carbon to carbon. The link is the machinery PLAN 7c asked
// for: a per-curve transform of the BENEFIT, identity everywhere else.
//
// ⚠️ THE OPTIMISER STILL MAXIMISES THE PRODUCT, and that is deliberate, not a
// shortcut. `log` is monotone so the argmax is identical, and the product avoids the
// one place the log form breaks: at full closure `A = -R_d < 0` and `log A` does not
// exist, which is exactly the endpoint hazard 11 requires to be a candidate. So the
// link is the right way to STATE this cost and the wrong way to SEARCH for it.
//
// ⚠️ SOX IS NOT A `CostCurve` MEMBER YET, and the obstacle is smaller than this
// comment first claimed. With the link above, `dprofit_dpsi_stem<K>` needs
// `A_prime*dci_dpsistem / A` in place of `A_prime*dci_dpsistem`, plus the same
// factor on the energy-balance term -- a per-curve factor on the benefit term, which
// is a shape the existing expression already supports. What it does NOT need is the
// whole expression replaced. That is the route in; it is unbuilt because nothing in
// production calls that function (grep: only `test_leaf.cpp`) and no consumer needs
// a prescribed-point evaluation here. A caller wanting one calls
// `profit_psi_stem_SOX` directly.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS **NOT** A REASON, because it is already true: that this writes a
// non-carbon number into `profit_`. `optimise_psi_stem_ProfitMax` already puts a
// DIMENSIONLESS normalised profit in the same field TF24 fills with carbon, so a
// caller comparing `profit_` across optimisers is exposed whether or not SOX exists
// -- this makes it a third kind rather than a second. The guide's rule for
// `hydraulic_cost_` ("a third meaning behind the same name is how a reader quotes
// the wrong number") applies to `profit_` too and is not enforced there. Worth a
// separate field per objective kind; not worth pretending this curve introduced it.
