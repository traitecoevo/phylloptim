// The root-architecture model: how carbon invested in roots becomes hydraulic

//
// ⚠️ THIS IS A HELPER, NOT PART OF THE SUPPLY PATH. Nothing in this package
// calls it. `Leaf::set_physiology` takes the resistances themselves (#33), so
// which root-architecture model is in force is the caller's business, exactly as
// which conductance-versus-height model produced `leaf_specific_conductance_max`
// already was. It stays here, public and tested, because the arithmetic is worth
// sharing and because the golden grid calls it -- see the note on the in-place
// overload below.
//
// Each layer's root carbon is split 1/3 vertical : 2/3 horizontal, and
//   network_.r_R_H_min[i] = beta_R_H / c_r_h        (min horizontal resistance, i.e. the
//                                           reciprocal of max conductance)
//   r_R_V[i]     = beta_R_V * dz[i]^2 / c_r_v (vertical; dz[i]^2 because
//                                           vertical conductivity scales with
//                                           root cross-sectional area, and the
//                                           segment spanning layer i is dz[i]
//                                           long)
//   network_.r_R_V_sum[i] = cumulative vertical resistance from the surface to layer i.
//
// ⚠️ `dz` IS PER LAYER, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN GENERALITY FOR ITS
// OWN SAKE. It was one scalar until #626, which was correct only for a profile of
// equal layers and silently wrong for any other. The property that fails is
// DISCRETISATION INVARIANCE: with a root density uniform over depth, the
// layer-integrated carbon in layer i is c_r_V[i] = (C/3)*dz[i]/D, so the
// per-layer form gives r_R_V[i] = 3*beta_R_V*D*dz[i]/C and the total
// sum(r_R_V) = 3*beta_R_V*D^2/C -- independent of how the column is sliced, as it
// must be, since slicing is a numerical choice and not a property of the plant. A
// single scalar dz = D/n breaks that: total resistance picks up a factor
// (D/n)^2 * sum(1/dz[i]) / D^2, which is 1 only for equal layers. Measured with a
// 2 cm surface layer over 1.5 m in five layers, it inflates total vertical root
// resistance 3.68x and throttles uptake, with nothing anywhere reporting it.
//
// So the reduction test is a total, not a per-layer value, and it is the one
// worth keeping: sum(r_R_V) must not depend on the profile.
//
// The returned vectors are sized to the deepest layer with non-zero root carbon,
// so the hot loop only iterates over layers that actually contain roots.
//
// A free function rather than a member, because it is a *model of the plant* and
// not of water transport: keeping it out of MultiLayerRoots is what lets an
// alternative supply path exist without inventing a root system.
//
// NOTE on zero-carbon layers: a layer with no roots currently gets
// r_R_H_min = 0, i.e. *zero* horizontal resistance, which is infinite
// soil-to-root conductance in a layer with no roots -- backwards. It appears
// unreachable from plant today (max_soil_layer truncates at the last non-zero
// layer, and plant's Q() root distribution does not produce an exact interior
// zero), so this preserves the behaviour rather than changing it silently.
//
// Fills `out` in place so its buffers are reused: a per-solve caller runs this
// once per solve, and building five fresh vectors each time measured
// +0.074 us/call (0.061 -> 0.135), about +2% of a whole solve. That is why this
// overload exists and why it is the one plant uses -- it holds a RootNetwork as a
// strategy member and refills it, the same way it already held the root-carbon
// buffer. The value-returning overload below is for tests and one-off callers,

// SOIL -> ROOT-COLLAR WATER SUPPLY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The water supply side of the model, lifted out of Leaf (issue #2). Everything
// here answers one question: given a collar potential, how much water can the
// root system deliver, and how fast does that change? The gas-exchange core does
// not need to know that soil has layers -- it only ever consumes
//
//   E_up  = uptake(P_collar)        and       dE_up/dP = duptake_dpsi(P_collar)
//
// so this is where a single-potential alternative will plug in (stage 3).
//
// Scientific model (after Potkay et al. 2021; prototyped in plant's
// vignettes/models/root_water_uptake.Rmd as E_from_Soil_to_Root_Collar):
//
// The root system is represented as a set of parallel soil layers, each
// connected to a single root collar (the point where roots join the stem).
// Within each layer i, water flows from soil to collar driven by the water
// suction gradient (T_collar - T_soil[i]), corrected for the gravitational
// head needed to lift water to the layer midpoint (gravity_head * z_soil_mid).
//
// The hydraulic resistance of each layer is the sum of two terms:
//   * r_R_H : horizontal (intra-layer, soil->root) resistance. Set during
//             set_root_network as network_.r_R_H_min[i] / f_r, where r_R_H_min scales
//             with the carbon invested in horizontal roots and f_r is the
//             fractional loss of conductivity from the root vulnerability
//             curve at the operating potential.
//   * r_R_V : vertical (inter-layer, along the root axis to the collar)
//             resistance, accumulated from the surface down to layer i
//             (r_R_V_sum). It scales with dz^2 / carbon-in-vertical-roots.
//
// Because the root vulnerability curve f_r is non-linear in psi, the
// horizontal resistance is evaluated using the *average* fractional
// conductivity over the potential interval spanned between the soil and the
// collar (T_src_min..T_src_max). This mean is obtained as
// (1/(b-a)) * integral_a^b f_r dpsi from a pre-integrated curve
// (root_vuln_integral_from_psi) with two spline evals, the same technique used
// for stem transpiration in Leaf::setup_transpiration.
//
// SIGN CONVENTION: every water potential here is a POSITIVE MAGNITUDE in MPa,
// as everywhere else in this package (#25). psi_soil_ arrives that way and stays
// that way -- there is no second representation and no flip. The vulnerability
// splines are indexed by magnitude, so they are read directly. Where an equation
// needs one potential to oppose another the minus sign is written in the
// equation: the collar draws water when its magnitude exceeds the soil's, so the
// flux numerator is (T_collar - T_soil - gravity_head).
//
// TWO OUTPUTS ARE NOT OWNED HERE. E_up and the per-layer soil_consumption
// buffer are passed in by reference rather than stored, because plant reaches
// into `leaf.E_up_` / `leaf.soil_consumption_[a]` by name and *writes back*
// into them after crown integration, in TF24_Strategy::net_mass_production_dt.
// They are plant's buffers, not this object's state. Note the deliberate unit split:
// E_up is kg H2O m^-2 s^-1, soil_consumption[i] is mol, converted downstream.

// The active inputs the uptake path reads, as a view.
//
// A VIEW rather than an owned bundle, because there are two owners: the double
// path assembles one from this object's own members (held_supply below), and the
// active path from vectors its caller owns. One uptake_impl then serves both,
// where an owned type would force the double path to copy its own state.
//
